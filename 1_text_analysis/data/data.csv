Our main objective is to improve the quality life of our children and youth through free music education, social inclusion, and musical activities in order to prevent violence in El Salvador. There is a complex problematic in El Salvador and lack for equal opportunities for this reason many young people and adolescents join gangs. In 2012, Fundación EDYTRA with the support of the World Bank, founded the “Youth Symphony Orchestra and Choir Polígono Don Bosco”. It is formed by 500 children and youth from 60 at-risk public schools from San Salvador, El Salvador. With your help we will be able to provide free and secure transportation for our 500 children and youth from the Orchestra and Choir. Be part of our team!

Security and health costs associated to crime and violence contribute up to 8% of GDP. Life is not easy for children and Youth from El Salvador; they do not have opportunities to fully develop their personal skills. For years, youth gangs have controlled these areas by mugging and threatening locals- The gangs are also constantly recruiting new young members. In El Salvador, to move from one area to another is too dangerous for most of them are gang ridden areas. By providing a private and free transportation for our beneficiaries from their schools or homes to the after-school workshops, they will feel safe to attend the classes and we will fill the youth´s free time- We can keep them busy through cultural and musical activities in order to develop musical skills and prevent them and hopefully keep them away forever from joining gangs. The music has helped them acquire discipline, motivation, self-confidence and, most importantly, a new perspective of their life which is messured by our pycologist and their schools´grade reports. We serve 500 girls, boys, and teenagers from 24 at risk zones of San Salvador that form the Youth Symphony Orchestra and Choir Poligono Don Bosco, our goal is to provide safe and free transportation to our members who come from 60 at-risk public schools of San Salvador and enrolled more at-risk girls. boys, and teenagers in our violence prevention program.

Si, se puede! Help us provide a class set of iPads to at-risk and low-income students in DC! San Miguel School enrolls only low-income and at-risk students in the DC metro area. We provide an education that changes the lives of students and their families. Latinos make up only about 2% of the STEM economy—a sector expected to have over 5 million openings by the time our students graduate high school and college and not enough qualified applicants. We need to equip our students with the skills necessary to secure these jobs and instill the confidence needed for them to pursue these stable, well-paying careers. In order to do that successfully, it is critical we integrate technology in the classroom before they reach high school. Our goal is a classroom set of iPads–a necessary tool to help our students succeed in high school and gain access to career opportunities in the STEM sector and beyond. Technological skills are a pre-requisite for careers today, not an option. By donating to our project, you make technology accessible for our students and empower them to better not only their tech skills, but also their literacy skills, as nearly all of our students are English language learners.","According to the White House Initiative on Educational Excellence for Hispanics, Hispanic students make up the largest public school minority, but score lower in math and science, in part because they are not sufficiently exposed to STEM subjects before college and in part because they have lower levels of college enrollment overall. In addition, Hispanics make up a mere 2% of the STEM sector. By implementing a fully integrated STEM Program, we can take action to close the gap in both achievement and opportunity for our target population. Serving a student body of English language learners, San Miguel already has an intensive and effective language arts program. As we work to serve more students and prepare students for the 21st century workforce, our next priority is strengthening and integrating our Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math Program (STEM). A strong STEM curriculum will provide our middle school students with an outstanding foundation for high school and college courses, expose them to new career fields, and equip them with vital problem-solving skills, but such a program requires not only access to, but also proficiency with technology. As of April 2015, the White House Hispanic initiative projects two STEM job openings per qualified jobseeker currently and 17% growth in the sector by 2020. With iPad-integrated technology in the classroom, San Miguel students will be ahead of the curve, honing a competitive advantage with their strong math and science background. By preparing our students with STEM technologies, we give them the tools now for sustainable future success. With your help we can break the cycle of poverty. We can change the statistics.

Some seasonal workers are hired abroad with the H2A visa, which permit a temporary stay in the USA. However many of these &#8216;guest&#8217; workers are charged with unreasonable and illegal fees since the start of their journey and/or they are not paid what was promised once they get to their field of work. In some other cases they are forced to live in substandard conditions. In almost all cases farmworkers don&#8217;t know their rights, where to file complains and their possibilities to recover the money that has been collected from them illegally. The goal of this project is to contact farmworkers, know the extent of the problem through the collection of data and establish the basis for providing appropriate support to them in McDowell and other near counties. This support would include fact sheets to provide them with information about their rights, assistance on the procedures for filing complains, including but not limited to translation, interpretation, orientation and connection with the available resources in the community.

Many of them feel isolated when they face unfair treatment and abuse, their inability to express in English, the false information they get from patrons or intermediaries and their fear to be deported without payment make them accept low payment, inequitable conditions and discriminatory conducts toward them. We want to know from them, hear their stories and establish the basis to help based on actual data. To achieve this, we need communication materials that invite them to contact us. We want to know what they need most so we connect them with the right justice offices and legal aids that exist in the community.

Immediate and Long-Term Positive Results for Economic Mobility.","According to Gallup, hope is a better predictor of student success in college than almost anything, including high school grade point average, ACT and SAT scores. According to Dr. Willie Elliott, national researcher on Child Savings Accounts and Director of the Center on Assets, Education, and Inclusion at the University of Kansas, pairing hope with means (i.e., money for school) is vital. Without the means to go to college, hope doesn’t get you there. Elliot’s research shows that wide gaps in college expectations by income levels and race almost disappear among all students with college savings of $500 or more. In families with $1 to $499 in savings designated for school are 3 times more likely to enroll in college and 4 times more likely to graduate than their peers from the same low-moderate income families without savings. But you don’t have to wait for high school graduation to see positive results. Elliot’s research shows that having a college saver identity also significantly improves student’s college preparedness as well. Kids in primary school with savings of $500 or less have statistically significant higher math and reading scores than their peers without designated savings. Our immediate goal, starting with the poorest zip code in Albuquerque, is that 500 Latino children, aged 0-11, develop college saver identities and thereby become engaged and motivated in succeeding in primary and secondary school, continue to college or other post-secondary training, and get out of poverty. Our longer term goal is that every child born in New Mexico starts life with a savings account. We will leverage the success of this program to do just that. Get the biggest bang for your buck—donate and help Latino kids and families immediately and for the long-term while at the same time impacting the systems of poverty and racism that too often go hand in hand.","All children should have the opportunity to thrive. No child deserves to be trapped in poverty with little opportunity and hope for the future. Because of structural, systemic racism, The American Dream, that all it takes to succeed in this country is individual effort and perseverance, is only a fantasy for many Latinos, and especially so for the families of predominantly mixed immigration status. Child Savings Accounts (CSAs) can make the American dream a reality for Latinos in poverty by increasing their access to post-secondary education and by doing so, increasing their economic mobility. US Department of Labor statistics show the powerful link between educational attainment and income. Recent research by Urahn, Currier, Elliott, Wechsler, Wilson, and Colbert shows 47% of children born in the bottom family income quintile remain in the bottom quintile as adults if they do not earn a college degree. In contrast, only 10% of those born in the bottom quintile who earn a college degree remain there as adults. People born in the bottom quintile who earn a college degree are three times more likely to make it to the top quintile than peers who do not.

(VIP) is a community based non-profit organization providing services to victims of domestic and gender violence. Established in 1984 as an East Harlem initiative, VIP fills a gap in services to Latina survivors and their children in an environment that is supportive and non-judgmental. Our mission is to lead Latina victims of domestic violence to safety, empower them to live free of violence and to help them reach and sustain their full potential. We pursue our mission by raising community awareness, engaging in activism and providing culturally competent services. As a domestic violence agency, VIP offers an array of services to help survivors lead healthy, safe, and productive lives including emergency and supportive housing, case management, advocacy, community education &amp; outreach, children &amp; youth services, financial literacy &amp; economic empowerment skills building, and a 24-hour bilingual hotline (English/Spanish). VIP’s unique approach to domestic violence intervention focuses on supporting women who are not only making the transition from victim to survivor, but also those who, as immigrants, find themselves in unfamiliar and often inhospitable territory. The social services network is a labyrinth of bureaucracy for anyone unfamiliar with its systems. Immigrants—especially those who are marginalized due to their immigration status, lack of language proficiency, low or no literacy, unfamiliarity with transportation systems and geography, or a misunderstanding of cultural implications—will find the system even more daunting and difficult to navigate on their own. In addition, the psychological and physical harm victims encounter create their own set of barriers which often stall a woman’s ability to heal from trauma of domestic abuse. This is where VIP’s assistance not only in providing access to information and services, but in creating individualized plans to meet client needs, makes a major impact in a victim’s ability to recreate a social network that will support her quest to lead an emotionally fulfilling, healthy, safe, productive, and stable life for herself and her children.

Our program is designed to support youth in discovering their passion and identities while connecting them to business strategies and creative innovation through agricultural design focused on social entrepreneurship and nontraditional leadership.

East Bay Sanctuary Covenant&#8217;s Unaccompanied Children (UAC) Services Program aims to address this barrier by providing necessary legal and social services to the vulnerable unaccompanied children population. From October 2013 to July 2014, the United States Department of Homeland Security apprehended roughly 62,998 Unaccompanied Children (children under the age of 18 who entered the United States without legal status, and without a parent or legal guardian) at the Southwest Border of the United States, a 100% increase from the previous Fiscal Year (FY). In FY 2013, 93% of UACs came from the äóìNorthern Triangleäó of Central America (Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras), with an additional 3% coming from Mexico.[1]In 2013, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees concluded that 58% of UACs from these four countries had potential or actual international protection needs: 48% of the children came to the US to escape violence related to organized crime in their home countries; 21% sought refuge from domestic violence; and another 10% &#8211; all from Mexico &#8211; had been exploited in the human smuggling industry.[2] Our UAC Services Program will fulfill three primary goals: providing crucial legal representation to UACs, supporting the holistic needs of vulnerable UACs, and building community engagement and social activism. East Bay Sanctuary Covenant (EBSC) will provide trauma-informed and culturally appropriate services to UACs. We will conduct monthly outreach to area schools, shelters, places of worship, and youth-focused service providers to identify UACs in need of legal representation and to build ongoing relationships with those stakeholders. EBSC is already in preliminary discussions with the Oakland Unified School District to establish a referral system for UACs needing legal assistance. Twice a year, our staff will conduct larger-scale community education events to highlight the needs of UACs and encourage the referrals of those children requiring legal assistance. Staff will develop a know-your-rights presentation and outreach materials for distribution at each of these events. EBSC will conduct in-house intakes to determine the UACs&#8217; eligibility for immigration relief. This intake will involve screening for abuse, neglect, trafficking, and psychosocial support, with referrals to appropriate service providers as necessary. EBSC has existing partnerships with a number of psychosocial care providers, including the Wright Institute, Family Works, Survivors International, and the Center for Survivors of Torture, as well as about ten pro bono or low-cost private psychotherapists. EBSC will provide pro bono legal assistance to UACs eligible for asylum, SIJS, or U-visa status, and represent the UACs in related probate, asylum, and immigration proceedings. Volunteer attorneys and law student interns will assist with client representation at asylum office interviews and immigration court proceedings. EBSC will network with other legal, psychosocial, and educational providers serving UACs and will organize quarterly best-practice exchanges among this group. Through these exchanges, we will build a comprehensive referral network of service providers to help address UACs&#8217; needs in a holistic manner. UACs also may be referred to partners through EBSC&#8217;s Community Development and Education program to empower them with educational, employment, and citizenship skills. Through these three goals, we aim to bring safety, stability, and hope to the lives of these children.

Primary among the procedural challenges for these children are the lack of government-appointed legal representatives and child advocates, as well as the lack of child-sensitive standards for immigration relief.[1] Legal representation has a significant impact on the outcome of immigration proceedings case; one study found that the likelihood of success in non-detained proceedings increased from 13% to 74% with the assistance of counsel. Pro bono or low-cost legal representation thus is essential for UACs to obtain the immigration relief that they so desperately need. Many of these children have suffered traumatic events that adversely affect their psychosocial well-being, including their ability to trust others, and their cognition, including their ability to focus and learn. Moreover, they find themselves in a new country and culture with limited access to advocates who speak their native language. These children thus also require legal services that are trauma-informed; age- and culturally appropriate; and available, where possible, in their mother tongue. For most UACs, this language would be Spanish or, particularly for Guatemalans, an indigenous language such as Mam, Quiche, or Kaqchikel. Our experience and expertise in providing legal assistance to immigrants and refugees from Central America is among the strongest in the Bay Area. EBSC was initially formed in 1982 when five Bay Area churches came together to declare their public commitment to offering sanctuary to Salvadoran and Guatemalan refugees who were fleeing war and persecution. Today, approximately 40% of our clients come from Central America, while 50% are from Mexico. Michael Smith, the Director of EBSC’s Refugee Rights Program, is a widely respected expert on the treatment of indigenous peoples in Guatemala and is frequently called to testify as an expert witness on behalf of indigenous Guatemalans in defensive asylum proceedings. A number of former Guatemalan clients and their children have returned to the Sanctuary as volunteers, often providing invaluable assistance as Spanish and Mam Maya interpreters. In addition to legal services, EBSC provides leadership development and capacity building through its Community Development and Education (CDE) program.

Pequeños y jóvenes viven el camino de la enfermedad acompañados, riendo y relajados para una mejor asimilación de los tratamientos a los que son sometidos. Gracias al desarrollo de este programa se han realizado más de 15,000 episodios de relajación con más de 100 manualidades originales, sin repeticiones, cada una desinfectada y empacada con todo el amor y profesionalismo de ASAC; 8,400 intervenciones terapéuticas a través de juegos diseñados para que el niño enfermo obtenga los recursos para vivir fortalecido el camino del cáncer; la presentación de más de 60 shows profesionales, adecuados y adaptados para generar todos los beneficios que trae la risa impactando de forma positiva en su salud. *Programa de Sueños.- Todos los niños tienen sueños por lo que ASAC analiza y estudia los casos para el cumplimiento de anhelos y necesidades de dichos pacientes en la medida de nuestras capacidades y siempre que su consecución sea factible y saludable. Nuestra prioridad son las sillas de ruedas y las pelucas de cabello natural elaboradas especialmente para las niñas beneficiadas. Se han cumplido 575 sueños, entre ellos 122 pelucas. La realización de un sueño no solo es ver cumplido un anhelo, el niño abraza este momento para CREER que no hay imposibles, les da esperanza y empoderamiento. *Programa de Paseos.- El cáncer no sólo merma la economía familiar sino además encarece las relaciones entre los miembros de la misma. ASAC organiza paseos de forma trimestral para que la enfermedad se quede en casa y la familia completa goce de un día divertido en espacios seguros. Más de 270 familias han participado en estas inolvidables experiencias. ASAC cree y confía en su trabajo al obtener resultados tanto en los pacientes como familiares que conciben al cáncer como una oportunidad de vida, no como el enemigo. Cada voluntario está comprometido con la labor que realiza por lo que se capacita mensualmente para que su acompañamiento tenga un impacto en la cultura del tratamiento.",ended,,AyudameaSonreir,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5YqHPQKKA4&#038;feature=youtu.be

Participate in monthly sessions where they develop life skills and critical thinking. As well as with a monthly economic scholarship to ensure continuity in their studies. To offer new opportunities to young indigenous women from low income families in Chiapas. These young women live in rural communities with different Mayan languages such as Tsotsil, Tseltal and Chol. Their teachers have identified them as talented students in science. We are helping the development of underprivileged communities because these young women can develop projects their communities&#8217; benefit. We will also encourage these young women to become mentors for other young women and thus creating a domino effect in rural communities of Chiapas. The mentoring program will, together with the project itself, increase the number of indigenous women from poor and marginalized communities studying scientific careers. Our project allows these young women to have access to better educational opportunities and to contribute with their talent to the development of their communities. Thus, we give other options to these girls when, in their communities, at the same age, they would be normally married and no longer study.","Chiapas is a state in the Southwest of Mexico and one of the poorest in the country. According to data from the National Council for the Evaluation of Social Development Policy (Coneval), in 2012 38% of the population lives in extreme poverty. The future is very limited for the majority of girls and young women in Chiapas: they study elementary school, marry young, have children and subsist on the little money that they can earn or that their husbands give them. Dependency and poverty is their outlook on life. In the elementary schools of Chiapas there are about 380,000 girls, but in middle schools there are only 135,000, in high school, 94,000 and in technical and professional studies, there are only 4,200 (the majority of these students are from more developed areas of the state, such as Tuxtla, the capital city.) Only 1.1% of the girls who enter elementary school in Chiapas complete a university education. There are two main factors for this level of desertion: tradition and poverty. Some of the traditions of the region (such as the vision of women as wives and mothers coupled with extreme poverty) give priority to the boys staying in school. That tradition is so deeply embedded that many women never consider the possibility of having the same rights as the men to study and have a profession. Our project will work to support 20 young women from different indigenous communities in Chiapas so that they do not abandon their studies.","PROYECTO COSTO MENSUAL COSTO SEM.

Our objective is to identify children and youngsters with interest and talent in sciences, to motivate them, to make them aware of their abilities and to support them during their studies so that through their own development they can contribute to the scientific and technological growth of Mexico. Watch a short video about PAUTA here. Programs and Projects Our model is based on constructivism. We use inquiry and collaborative work. We want the children and youngsters to develop scientific, social and communicative skills as well as creativity and social entrepreneurship. In our activities, the participants don’t find answers but questions, challenges that they need to solve collaboratively; they need to investigate, experiment, analyze, debate, explain and generate ideas in order to reach a solution. The purpose is to help them develop abilities to question, to find answers, so that the knowledge that they construct can be applied later in research projects that benefit their communities. The aim is to develop not only people with interest in science but also citizens with greater abilities to participate as agents of change in their communities. To develop our work, we have had different projects: PAUTA workshops, mentoring of talented indigenous girls and young women; science camps; young scientist workshops, mentorship with scientists, along with programs specially designed for parents and teachers.

This has been mainly originated by the changes in the eating culture, the consume of food with preservatives and a sedentary lifestyle, all of this factors generate overweight, obesity and later on diabetes, being this last one the cause of kidney, visual and motor disorders. The proposed strategy is the implementation of proper nutrition training as well as the setting of family vegetable gardens in the backyards, this has the intention of providing part of the food that the families need. This project has also the intention of establishing physical activation groups in order to set a series of sessions that will help to lower the overweight, the obesity and therefore also the diabetes. The main focus of these activities is to improve the health of those who have already diabetes, but also of those who have a high risk of getting this disease either if it&#8217;s caused by their own physiognomy or by the kinship with diabetics. The expected results are: The creation of awareness in the community of Trancas of the importance of proper nutrition; the training of 30 members of the community in order for them to spread what they&#8217;ve learned to the rest of the population; the setting of 60 backyard vegetable house gardens and 30 farms, all of which will produce food for the house consumption. The direct beneficiaries in the first stages will be 60 families, approximately 300 persons, after this we expect that all of the community will be benefited from the program. 12 inhabitants of the community will be trained to promote health care activities, they will also be trained in first aids in order to help the community members in case of scorpions stings, snake bites or fractures. They will be also trained to apply injections and control weight, sugar levels and blood pressure. All of of which will have an impact in the hole community, that is, in 500 inhabitants. Physical activation groups of by age: children, youth, adult women and older adults. Approximately there will be 110 beneficiaries in these activities.","It is important to achieve our goal because the consequences that the families suffer when there is one or more persons with diabetes are countless, this happens because most of the families do not have a medical service provided by the government. This situation pushes the families to attend private services in order to treat the diabetes. These services are normally outside the community, this means to the families adding to the medicines and the treatments expensive trips for the person who is treated and the companion. All of these factors affect the household economy and force people to search for means to cover the cost that these expenses arise. The immediate solution fore most of them is the migration, especially to the United States. Therefore it is important to prevent diabetes, to avoid the mentioned consequences, especially considering that most of the inhabitants are low-income families.","ACCIÓN COMUNITARIA DEL BAJÍO A.C.

Ultimately, teachers will leave The Learning Institute prepared for project-based instruction in Civic Education and Language Arts. The first Institute will launch in Suchitoto in November 2015 with a cohort of 30 high-performing college graduates and leaders. This cohort, equipped with innovative teaching practices, will commit to teaching at least two years in high-need schools in the region. Over their two-year tenure, the first cohort of teachers alone will make an impact on at least 1,200 students. El Salvador needs capable and ambitious teachers who have the training necessary to empower their children with the skillsets they need to thrive in the 21st century.","Every child deserves access to a quality education. Every citizen deserves to live without fear for his or her life. In El Salvador this is not the case. The country has the highest homicide amongst children and adolescents in the world. We know this does not have to be the reality. We know that in places like El Salvador there is a solution. Evidence tells us that with more access to quality education there is less violence. However, future generations of Salvadoran are robbed of this opportunity to end the cycle of violence and poverty. Low-income Salvadoran children are trapped in cycles of poverty without access to the high quality education that they deserve. On average, 7 out of 10 public school students enter high school. Only 4 will graduate. Those who do graduate do not have the skillset to change their reality, let alone be prepared for a 21st century economy. In the Learning Institute, teachers, students and community members will learn to collaborate effectively and solve conflicts as they arise. By strengthening peer relationships and fostering collaborative leadership, the Institute will begin to shift classroom and school culture, encouraging safe learning environments and positive classroom-community partnerships.","Teacher Institute $59,000 Facilities and Lodging $30,000 Curriculum Development $18,000 Facilitators $6,000 Materials $5,000",Igniting a movement of empowered leaders who are committed to making a promise for a better tomorrow.,"Enseña por El Salvador is a team of teachers, policy makers, education professionals and social entrepreneurs from El Salvador, the US, and Finland. Together with the Ministry of Education and in partnership with local schools and communities, we are igniting a movement of outstanding leaders who will reshape their country and believe that we can rebuild and create a better future. Students who have traditionally been from the most under-resourced public schools will have access to an education that is engaging, community-based, and conducive to deep learning. At Enseña por El Salvador, we believe in the inalienable right to a quality education for all children, regardless of their socioeconomic background. Everyday we work in order to uphold that right. We fundamentally believe that a quality education is an invaluable tool for marginalized children to access opportunities and have a better quality of life. At a country level, we believe that our commitment to a quality education will enable us to break the cycle of poverty, establish more integrated communities, and reduce crime rates and violence. In order to achieve this goal, we need everyone to be part of the solution and form alliances across multiple sectors",ended,20150226.0,EnsenaporES,

We will market health, civic engagement and fitness. The Grind for Your Soul: Skating Por Vida event will use the fashion and popular culture around skate boarding as a way to engage and expose youth and young adults to social justice, voting, and legislation. We will use the fashion, marketability and counter-culture theme that skate boarding and skateboarders are known for and use this “hipster” lifestyle to change the narrative that Salinas is dangerous, boring and scary for young students, young adults and visitors. Our project will amplify the message that Salinas is welcoming, healthy and hip. The project illuminates a need to re-establish a social justice lens that will combat violence both communal and systemic. Salinas has been plagued with having the highest Youth Homicide rate in CA 3 out of the past 4 years. Most of these shootings are of young Latino teenagers. The location of the event is in the heart of “barrio” known as Las Casitas. This area is known for everything from carne asadas (grilling meat) and pachangas (lively parties) to murders and tragedy. It’s important for this community to heal and not be over-reliant on policing and law enforcement. Our community doesn’t need transactional and parachute “experts”. By working directly with those most impacted we will get closest to the solution. We are going into the our current or old neighborhoods where we grew up amongst and with skaters, activists, gangsters, store owners, and the old viejitos and viejitas (older neighborhood statesmen) of the community and using our “License to Operate” but this time for community benefit, revitalization and empowerment. This event is not dependent on the government trying to save us. In contrast we will use this event to expose our community to our people power. The community members will be able to see that their children, grandchildren, nieces and nephews can have fun, be cool, and healthy and still partake in “youth culture” in a way that educates and creates awareness about social change. Local and Internet contributions will enhance our ability to bring a blend of organic and healthy food, pay for sanitary equipment, helmets, giveaways, and prize awards.","Salinas has a rich social activist history and although we can remain nostalgic on the work and legacy of the many 1970’s farmworker activist, it is time to begin cultivating the next generation of civic participation and leadership in Salinas where the median age is 26 years old. The goal of MILPA is to cultivate change makers for the next seven generations, and in Salinas, which is known as the Salad Bowl of America with a 8-9 billion a year industry. It is important to note the average farmworker salary is under $14,000 per year. Yet the profit goes to the rich landowners’ and gives peanuts to families and field workers. Our hard labor is taken for granted and event our art, culture is exploited with no return to our community instead “charity and donations” are sent everywhere else. The project will work endlessly to build a broader communication plan and effort to reclaim and market an intergenerational sense of neighborhood love in Salinas. Grind for Your Soul: Skating Por Vida will promote self-sustainability, self determination, ganas and salud, within the migrant and farm working community of Salinas. Most importantly funds will allow us to generate a pool of local talent that we can support long after the event. We would want to use the additional money to provide youth employment because “teens need money” and we can engage them in local community empowerment and leadership development. Visual The reason why were doing this is to raise awareness in regard to culture, consciousness, and movement building. This is to establish a regular language and lifestyle around youth and adult civic engagement. We will be promoting the development of community collaboration to move in a positive direction. We will collect data regarding who, what, where, and when latin@ community people are voting and even where they stand regarding health and technological disparities. The changes we hope to achieve will be engage and involve people in local civic conversations by braiding and blending the youth with the elders of the community to bridge the generational gap. We hope to be able to assist with some type of technology so that the youth from the community can help the elders within their homes navigate social media. We will measure this by conducting a pre and post survey and develop a plan of action to be able to bring more technology to the community as a whole. This will allow other to also be able to collect data so that they to may be able to conduct their own crowd funding if needed.","This event projected budget: 1.

The first time we did a skate event we did it back yard style, with little, to nothing to offer and over 300 people were in attendance so we need to be ready as we know the people will come out for us. Like many Latino “upstart” the first thing we did was collectively believe we could do it. It was essential that we overcame self-doubt and we told ourselves nobody was gonna do it better like we had been told by one our elders Juan Sanchez de Tejas. For results we were able to successfully educate local Board of Supervisors in not expanding a juvenile hall to 150 beds instead only 120 beds because our youth were meant to be leading and pursuing careers in the world not hurting and rotting in cages.

Could this be because there are not enough Latina/o Attorneys? How are organizations meeting the demands to help students of color achieve such prestigious positions? This year, the Youth Law Academy is launching a new Diversity Legal Pipeline Program (DLPP) to help more Latino students and students of color enroll in law school. The DLPP is a series of pre-law workshops for college students that will allow students to hone their writing and critical thinking skills; gain an understanding of law school admission requirements; attend career workshops led by attorneys who practice public interest law; and focus on learning soft skills that can be transferred to educational and career goals. The 10-day workshop will serve low-income Latino students and students of color who are first-generation college students. These students need additional support to understand the process to obtain an advanced degree and apply to law school. In addition, first-generation Latino students need opportunities to improve their writing skills while in college so they can gain the confidence and skills needed to apply to law school. The Diversity Legal Pipeline Program (DLPP) is an exciting new diversity pipeline initiative that will be available to undergraduates enrolled in the Youth Law Academy program and those attending a university or community college in the greater San Francisco Bay Area. The program will be held in the summer of 2015. This unique experience will expose undergraduates to IRAC writing, an overview of what the first year of law school is like, and firsthand experiences from attorneys practicing in Public Interest law. At the end of the workshop, students will gain valuable insights on how writing and critical thinking skills are imperative to be a competitive candidate for law school. Overall, the DPP will advance our mission to foster the next generation of attorneys and judges of color by preparing undergraduate students from disadvantaged groups for law school. Over four decades of serving the Latino community, Centro Legal has seen the need for providing academic and support services to help Latino youth complete high school and college and transition to law school. In 2005, Centro Legal responded to this need by founding the Youth Law Academy (YLA). The YLA is striving to build a diversity pipeline in the law by helping low-income Latino youth and youth of color succeed in college, explore careers in the law, and transition to law school. The YLA is unique in that it provides long-term support to students, from their sophomore year of high school through college and law school. This year, the YLA is launching the next phase of its diversity pipeline initiative, the Diversity Legal Pipeline Program (DLPP). The DLPP is a 10-day law-school preparation workshop for low-income Latino students and students of color. While the YLA serves all youth of color, a majority of the high school and college students in the YLA are first or second-generation Latino students. The current racial breakdown of the YLA is as follows: 87% Latino, 8% African American, and 5% Asian/Pacific Islander. The YLA has found that for Latino students, limited-English skills, limited education of parents or guardians, and family pressure to work rather than attend college are all factors that aggravate their ability to graduate from high school and enroll in college or law school. The struggle to make ends meet compounds the lives of Latino families, who face high rates of poverty. In addition, many immigrant youth, particularly undocumented youth, face discrimination and the constant threat of deportation. These factors can harm their self-esteem and lead to anxiety. Thanks to Centro Legal’s legacy of providing services to the Latino population, the YLA is able to offer culturally-sensitive support services to Latino students and their families and help them overcome barriers to attending college and law school. The seven-year YLA program arms students with the competitive edge they need to succeed in college and law school through challenging curriculum, long-term mentorship, and hands-on experience in the law. YLA students are paired with attorney mentors who provide career guidance and personal support; attend law firm and law school visits; conduct a Mock Trial; and complete Foundations in Law and Ethnic Studies in the Law courses, which expose them to the law and prepare them for college-level work. To ensure students are prepared for college and a legal career, the YLA provides ongoing academic counseling. Each student meets with the Program Director and parents twice yearly to create and review an Individual Action Plan for academics to ensure they complete UC/CSU prerequisites. Seniors also complete a SAT prep course and attend Transition to Adulthood seminars, which cover topics such as resume writing and time management. To gain exposure to legal field, students attend field trips to an Alameda County courthouse, law firms, and the UC Hastings Day at Law School event. Students are also connected to pre-law resources such the Law Fellows Program at the UCLA School of Law and For People of Color, Inc. Additionally, the costs of LSAT preparation courses and the LSAT exam can be prohibitive for low-income students to apply. Therefore, the YLA educates students about LSAT resources and fee waiver options. The YLA is successfully helping low-income Latino youth overcome the barriers that prevent them from completing college and transitioning into law school. To date, 96% of YLA students are enrolled in college, 11 have graduated college, and four are on track to enroll in law school.","As a legal service provider that has worked with the low-income Latino community for 46 years, Centro Legal witnesses firsthand the lack of diversity within the legal profession and the negative effects it has on the community. In Centro Legal’s experience, one major reason for lack of diversity in the legal profession is lack of exposure to legal professionals and careers in law. Therefore, the Youth Law Academy (YLA) strives to empower Latino, immigrant, and students of color to succeed academically and expose them to a career in law. Towards that end, the YLA has helped 59 students graduate high school, 46 enroll in college, and 11 to graduate college. While we have had significant success in helping our students enroll in and complete college, we continue to find that low-income Latino students face challenges to prepare for and transition to law school. Major challenges facing these students include improving writing skills, costs of applying to law school, and low self-confidence. In response to these issues, the YLA is launching the Diversity Legal Pipeline Program (DLPP) to help more low-income Latino students and students of color access resources they need to prepare for and transition law school. Since most first-generation Latino college students struggle to apply for and afford college, navigating the law school application process is an even greater challenge. In addition, costs to apply to law school can add up to several hundred dollars. Costs include LSAT testing, registration to the Law School Admission Council for the Credential Assembly Service (CAS), and an application fee for each law school that the student is interested in applying to. There are few if any fee waivers for these registration fees. Therefore, the YLA is seeking funding to help low-income students in our program cover some of these costs. With additional funding, the YLA can cover the cost of an LSAT prep course, LSAT test fee, and CAS registration fees for 10 low-income students who enroll in the program. For many low-income students and families, these fees alone can be prohibitive and deter students from applying to law school.","Youth Law Academy 2014-15 Program Budget EXPENSES Personnel Youth Law Academy Program Director @ 100% FTE 58,000.00 Youth Law Academy Program Coordinator @ 100% FTE 40,000.00 Executive Director @ 10% FTE 7,700.00 Development Associate @ 10% FTE 4,600.00 Litigation Director@ 2% FTE 1,200.00 Immigration Staff Attorney @ 2% FTE 920.00 Finance &amp; Operations Assistant @ 5% FTE 1,900.00 Benefits @ 16% 18,291.20 Total Personnel 132,611.20 Operations Computer Expense 500.00 Princeton Review 4,950.00 Dues &amp; Subscriptions 963.57 Insurance 5,620.80 Meeting Expense 449.66 Training Supplies &amp; Materials 5,000.00 Office Equipment 1,541.71 Office Supplies 1,204.46 Postage &amp; Shipping 963.57 Printing &amp; Duplication 500.00 Professional Development 500.00 Rent &amp; Utilities 12,914.61 Tech Support 899.33 Telecommunications 2,694.77 Travel (includes Youth Transportation) 642.38 Scholarships 71,950.00 Total Operations 111,294.85 Subtotal 243,906.05 Administration @ 10% 24,390.61 TOTAL EXPENSES 268,296.66 INCOME COMMITTED CARRYOVER FROM FY 2012-13 * 71,950.00 Foundations East Bay College Access Network Funding 19,500.00 Morris Stulsaft Foundation 15,000.00 Thomas J.

Its legal services provide counsel, advice, referral, and representation to thousands of individuals a year in the areas of housing, employment, and immigration. A focal point in all our programs is to educate and empower low-income communities, particularly the Latino immigrant community, to become more integrated members of society. Our programs focus on helping immigrants overcome barriers that prevent them from accessing legal and educational services such as fear of deportation, limited education, or lack of English language proficiency. Centro Legal supports diversity in the law by training individuals of color to become culturally-competent, skilled legal advocates through internships and fellowships for undergraduates, law students, and young attorneys. Centro Legal expanded its commitment to diversity in the legal profession in 2005 by founding the Youth Law Academy (YLA), a program that helps low-income Latino youth and youth of color, particularly those who are the first in their family to go to college, become the leaders and attorneys of tomorrow. The YLA’s success is based on the provision of individualized support, starting in the sophomore year of high school through college and beyond. The YLA program offers individualized, culturally-sensitive support to some of the most vulnerable youth in Oakland, which in turn, helps them build self-esteem and confidence to attend college and law school. Thanks to Centro Legal’s broader work, the YLA is uniquely positioned to address barriers facing undocumented students. Currently, 18% of YLA students self-report as undocumented and 46% report having a family member who is undocumented. The immigrant community is often hesitant to inquire about educational or financial aid resources, due to the fear of deportation. The YLA provides support to families through workshops and one-on-one meetings in a culturally-sensitive way that eliminates confusion and fear. The YLA is committed to helping undocumented youth attain their dreams of attending college and provides them with education regarding options for immigration relief.",ended,20150222.0,youthlawacademy,

Oftentimes, when parents cannot provide the basic necessities for their children, students miss the beginning of the school year, setting them back academically. Considering that many of our students have a poor relationship with education when they begin here at the Center, they need every advantage and all the assistance they can get. For the past several years, our Backpack Project has provided all the basic necessities our youngsters need to start school. We started this project to ensure that all of our participants are prepared for the first day of school with a backpack and all the necessary school supplies. Providing these basic supplies takes a great burden off the parents of our students. We have recently included hygiene supplies in the backpacks because many of our participants’ families cannot afford things like deodorant, shampoo, and toothpaste, and these items are just as necessary for a child to be prepared for school; the lack of these supplies can do long term damage to these children’s identity development. Keeping clean is an important part of staying healthy. Being clean and well presented is also an important part of confidence for teenagers. Items such as toothpaste, shampoo, and deodorant are vital for students overall health and self esteem. Unfortunately, in many cases, our program is the only place they can get such items.","New Britain has the second highest teen pregnancy rate in the state, twice the state’s average. Unemployment and dropping out is very common. Our participants are poverty-stricken, mostly Latino boys and girls, who are largely from single-parent households.

Because of this, they miss school and fall behind their more well-off peers, perpetuating the cycle of poor education and poverty. Our backpack project has allowed all of our participants, and many of their younger siblings, to be prepared for success in school. High school graduation is an ultimate goal of this program as a whole, and this project is a key step in achieving that goal. Currently we are facing severe cuts from our major funding source, the CT Department of Social Services. We do not want to use private funds for this project, but we will if necessary because of its vast importance. Unfortunately, that would mean that we have to take away from another aspect of our program. Since the project has started, all of our students have received a backpack full of supplies at the end of the summer. We have even been able to provide their younger siblings with full backpacks as well. As we hoped, attendance for the first day, and week, of school has increased. Our participants face a lot of hardships, but because of this project, they are able to start the school year on equal footing with their more well-off peers.","Backpacks for all students: 60 backpacks x $25 each = $1500 School supply set (supplies to fill all backpacks, including notebooks, pencils, calculators, etc.): 60 sets x $12.50 each = $750 Hygiene supplies to fill all backpacks (including deodorant, shampoo, conditioner, toothpaste, etc.): 60 sets x $12.50 each = $750 Total = $3,000 &nbsp;","Our mission is to eliminate teen pregnancy by addressing its root causes, assuring high school graduation, and promoting adult self-sufficiency.

The clinic has been in business for over three years and some of our computer systems are beginning to fail. We have determined that we need an additional three personal computers and one lap-top to replace older equipment and keep the clinic efficiently running. Our EMR system is an extremely secure portal that needs to run on a secure server utilizing updated equipment. Since our inception, we have built partnerships within the medical community to offer prenatal and deliver services to expectant moms, well woman checks, cancer screenings which include mammograms and colonoscopies and pediatric well-child checks.","Our medical services are sought out by many in our community for two reasons: our low cost approach to health care and our culturally competent services, our entire medical staff is bilingual.

This year an unprecedented expansion project will take our impact from 1,500 students and 120 new teachers in 2014 to 5,000 students and 200 new teachers in 2015 with another 250 volunteers taken from universities and teacher colleges around Mexico. Most importantly all summer institutes aim to serve students in under-resourced or under-performing school. This expansion is part of an amazing partnership with the Secretary of Public Education in the state of Puebla, Mexico to bring a proven impact and training model developed by Teach For Mexico over the past two years of its operation the goal of which is to expand impact to more students, while deepening the collaboration with teacher training institutions and universities. We hope to find that students gain a broader access to high-quality supplemental instruction during the summer. As all grade levels in urban, semi-urban and rural schools will benefit from the summer institute&#8217;s expansion, we expect the major types of communities in Puebla to be affected including indigineous communities.","Mexico faces a reality where 5,000 students drop out of school every day amounting to only 36% of students currently finishing high school from those who started. Recent studies show Mexico placing 53rd out of 65 countries tested according to basic high school skill sets with only 60% of students leaving school with intermediate reading comprehension skills. Teach For Mexico, during its summer institute, goes to the heart of this problem by putting more students in school while focusing on academically rigorous basic skill development in reading, writing, math, and English. During summer institute, the high-needs schools and student populations most vulnerable to and affected by these statistics. Simultaneously, teachers are preparing themselves themselves to work for two years honing their pedagogical and leadership skills in order to take their knowledge and experience with high-needs environments to other work environments and contribute positively. The challenge with such an undertaking is recruiting, motivating, and coaching the teachers who are to impact these students. We know any student can learn but it takes a team effort to afford opportunities children who are most at risk of keeping these current statistics the status quo. Teach For Mexico intends to build and expand that team this year by adding 100 new teachers to the cohort size and training them to develop into a a level 3 out of 5 on our teacher excellence and achievement rubrics. Similarly, for our students, we have developed skill-based achievement tests with the goal of all students making at least one level of skill development depending on the grade level and subject, which is being taught.","Senior PEMs 2013,2014 who will train the new 200 PEMs = 32 Days of Pre-training = 14 Cost per night = $340 MXN Total cost = $152320 MXN = $10400 USD","Teach For Mexico aims to create, train, and support a network of leaders, who work collaboratively in order to create an impact both in and out of the classroom while working towards social justice.","Teach For Mexico is part of the international network Teach For All with 35 partners and growing with the model of leadership and training. Teach for Mexico has also formed strategic partnerships with the secretaries of public education in Puebla, Guanajuato, and Nuevo León to bring our teachers' impact to the classrooms. Likewise we have partnered with other organizations like ALFA, CONALEP, and ENOVA in order to place our teachers in school programs serving under-resourced school areas. This has allowed our program to spread to 5 states with 210 teachers and 35 staff members. These teachers teach over 12,000 students across these 5 states. In order to support these teachers in our program they are put into teams of 17 to 20 with an academic tutor leading the team in charge of their professional and classroom skills development. Teachers are given monthly trainings in order to develop these professional and classroom skills.

All children are fully engaged in a variety of reading and writing activities, with some students working in groups and others reading independently. As you circulate the room, you see students exploring books of various genres from their classroom library. This literacy rich environment and experience exemplifies one high level strategy of SFUSD’s Comprehensive Approach to Literacy, an instructional framework that utilizes a workshop approach to grow a love of reading and writing in all students. As an essential component of SFUSD’s Core Curriculum, this approach develops a host of dispositions and behaviors that meet the demands of SFUSD’s Graduate Profile, setting all students up for success in the 21st century. With your partnership and funding support, we will equip every Pre-Kindergarten to Fifth Grade classroom at Elementary Schools in the Mission Neighborhood of San Francisco with the books and tools required to fulfill SFUSD’s vision and mission to create equitable portals of opportunity for all students. Your backing will provide full classroom libraries filled with content-rich, challenging, developmentally appropriate, culturally responsive books so 100 percent of children can learn and thrive. &nbsp;","According to researchers, reading proficiently by the end of the third grade can be a make-or-break benchmark in a child’s educational development. A child who is not reading on grade level by the end of third grade is four times as likely to drop out of school when compared to peers who are reading on grade level. Poor children who are not reading a grade level by the end of third grade are 13 times more likely to drop out than wealthier and proficient peers . Given the chronic underfunding of public education across California, SFUSD has lacked an opening to fully invest in enriching literacy material. A rich supply of books improves reading performance regardless of a child’s economic status or even the parents’ literacy levels. But the disparity in reading scores between children remains a persistent gap. 76 percent of San Francisco Latino third graders were below proficient in the 2014-15 Smarter Balance Assessments, compared to 52 percent districtwide. The need is enormous. The bottom line is that if we don’t get a dramatically higher number of children on track as proficient readers, the US and San Francisco will lose a growing and essential proportion of its human capital to poverty, and the price will be paid not only by individual children and families, but by the entire country and City. The world economy demands a more educated workforce, and grade-level reading proficiency is key. Students who cannot read proficiently are especially unlikely to obtain a post-secondary degree, which is necessary for the types of jobs that make America globally competitive in the age of information and communications technology.","100% of Donations will go directly to purchasing leveled libraries for each classroom at each of the Schools in the Mission.

Many children are eligible for Special Immigrant Juvenile Status (SIJS). The funds collected for this project will cover or partially cover the legal fees for these cases so that more children have access to legal services. Last year, 3 out of 5 kids went to court without a lawyer. Kids who go without a lawyer are 3 times as likely to be ordered to be deported than those whom have legal representation. By donating $1,350 you can cover all of the legal fees for one child. Donating $675 can cover half of the costs for one child. If we reach our goal of $25,000 we can provide: 15 SIJS cases free of cost to clients OR 30 SIJS cases at half cost. We want to help youth like Alejandra stay stafe: Alejandra is a 13 year old girl who emigrated from Guatemala. At the tender age of five years old, her mother left her children to seek safety in the United States because of domestic violence directed at her by her former partner. Alejandra ’s father was a dangerous and abusive man. He forced Alejandra’s older sister into an arranged marriage. Alejandra, fearing the same would happen to her, looked for support elsewhere and found it in the home of her grandparents. When her grandfather passed away and her grandmother was unable to support her by herself, Alejandra and her mother feared that she’d fall once again into the hands of her father, who would not sign the paperwork to allow her to come to the U.S. on a visa, so she fled to the United States. Thirteen year old Alejandra made the journey to the United States by herself with the assistance of coyotes. During the trip she lacked food at times and faced harsh climates. She saw many terrible things along the way. Once Alejandra crossed the U.S./Mexico border, she was apprehended by border patrol (U.S. Customs and Border Protection) and was held in a holding facility in Texas. She was later moved to an Office of Refugee Resettlement facility in Los Angeles where she stayed for 23 days. Alejandra’s mother petitioned for her to be released to her home in Virginia. When they met in the airport, it was an incredibly happy moment for Alejandra and her mother – she was safe and happy to be with her mother after over eight years! Alejandra is currently happily living with her mother and is waiting for the school year to begin – she hopes to be a doctor when she is older. Ayuda is helping Alejandra seek immigration relief to be able to stay in the U.S. with her mother. Alejandra and her mother are desperate for her case to work out when it comes before immigration court in the near future. Together, we are fighting to keep her in the United States, safe and sound.","Providing legal representation for minors is complex – it requires expertise in state family law and federal immigration law, and for the attorney to be barred in the state where the minor lives. It is also expensive because these cases are labor intensive. According to the Office of Refugee Resettlement, 85% of all children seeking refuge (~60,000 in 2014) will be placed with relatives. 15% of all of these children will be placed in Maryland, Virginia or the District of Columbia. The vast majority of these children are seeking legal assistance. Ayuda’s services ultimately give child migrants the opportunity to build secure and successful futures in this country. However, the availability of our services is limited due to our capacity; additional funding for cases for migrant children will allow us to serve (55-110) more children a year who have this desperate need.

In the Town of Siler City, 51% of the town’s residents are Latino. Despite population growth, economic opportunities have dramatically decreased. Since 2008, Chatham and Siler City have survived the closing of most of the County’s main poultry processing and manufacturing employers with the loss of over a thousand jobs. The most affected were the county’s Hispanic residents who came or were brought to work at these sites—33.4% live below the poverty line. In response to this need, we created our Income Development Center. Located in our computer lab in downtown Siler City, we have been active since February 2012 and have assisted Latinos and non-Latinos in finding and applying for jobs, resume assistance, preparing themselves for the job market, gaining job and life skills through income-related trainings, growing their small businesses and creating more local job opportunities, and connecting with resources to start and secure funding for their own businesses. Yet more work needs to be done to lift our constituents and our community out of poverty. With these commitments in mind, we will coordinate a Small Business Development Academyfrom July 1, 2014 to June 30, 2015. The purpose of the academy will be to help foster, support, incubate and grow Latino small businesses with a focus on cooperative and community based businesses in Siler City. In the wake of the town and county&#8217;s economic downturn, small family owned businesses are playing a crucial role on maintaining the community&#8217;s social and economic vitality. By investing on local Latino entrepreneurs-a growing sector of the economy&#8211;we will be able to provide more stable sources of income and address unemployment regardless of documentation status. We believe that people deserve employment with dignity and a fair wage. We strive to foster businesses and employment opportunities that create a safer, fairer, and better community. Our focuses are on sustainable fair wage jobs, shared ownership, democratic workplaces, and community based businesses.We hope that through these focuses we can help find a way for our community to generate not only personal sources of income, but also increase the shared wealth in their community.Moreover, while the State continues to search for the next plant owner and State agencies struggle to connect workers with existing jobs that may not match up to their industry specific experience, the IDC will work to break crippling boom-bust cycles that have become rampant across small industrial towns and assist in the development of smaller businesses and inclusive economic development and income options.","The overarching goal is to empower our Latino constituents to generate stable sources of income and address situations of long-term and cyclical unemployment in a sustainable way regardless of documentation status. To achieve our goal, in 2014-2015 we will: Hold a small business academy consisting of a 12-week intensive training in the spring and fall with one training per week on topics ranging from business start-up 101, business plan development, identifying needs and markets, networking, accounting, and hiring practices Provide one group meeting/training per week and individual meetings and follow up. Provide monthly business start up support groups open to small business owners and academy participants. Create a governing board for the IDC to move forward in generating a cooperative venture. Outcomes 50 people will attend our small business academy and receive training on topics ranging from business start-up 101, business plan development, identifying needs and markets, networking, loans, accounting, and hiring practices. 10 participants will open or begin the process of opening up their own small business. 5 participants will be identified and provided capacity building training to create a governing board for the IDC to move forward in generating a cooperative venture and developing a business plan.","Income Development Center 2013-2014 2014-2015 Program Budget $61,905.50 $69,019.25 &nbsp; Revenue NC Rural Center $45,000.00 $ &#8211; United Way $ 3,000.00 $ 3,000.00 Chatham County $ &#8211; $ 2,858.00 USDA Strikeforce $ &#8211; $20,000.00 HIP DACA $ 1,810.00 $ &#8211; Wells Fargo $ &#8211; $10,000.00 CCHD $ &#8211; $ 7,700.00 Fund for Democratic Communities $10,000.00 $ 5,000.00 Town of Siler City $ &#8211; $ 2,500.00 Art Of Giving $ &#8211; $ 3,500.00 Donation Box $ 2,095.50 $ 4,461.25 HIP GIVE $10,000.00 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Total Revenue $61,905.50 $69,019.25 Expenses 2013-2014 2014-2015 Payroll Expenses/Direct Deposit Fees $ 14.00 $ 14.00 Basic Needs Coordinator/ Intake Assistant $ &#8211; $ &#8211; Youth Program Coordinator $ &#8211; $ &#8211; Interim ED/IDC Coordinator $36,200.00 $37,000.00 Resource Development Coordinator $ &#8211; $ &#8211; VOCA/Emergency Services Program Coordinator $ &#8211; $ &#8211; Executive Director $ 3,000.00 $10,500.00 FAST Specialist $ &#8211; $ &#8211; Community Services Program Coordinator $ &#8211; $ &#8211; &nbsp; Health Insurance $ 2,400.00 $ 2,400.00 Retirement $ &#8211; $ &#8211; Payroll Taxes $ 3,615.00 $ 3,461.00 &nbsp; Contractual Program Services/Bookkeeping Svcs. $ &#8211; $ &#8211; Educational Programs/Facilitators $ 370.00 $ 1,190.00 Emergency Assistance to individuals $ &#8211; $ &#8211; In Site Practice Stipend (IDC) $ 4,800.00 $ &#8211; Professional Services/Audit $ &#8211; $ &#8211; Rent-Administrative-Victims and B.

What type of horrors do these children face in their home countries, that their only choice is to travel alone and afraid to a foreign country? Because death is almost certain in their home country, fleeing and coming to the U.S. must be their only hope. Centro Legal de la Raza’s overall goal is to provide desperately needed legal services to unaccompanied children and families with young children fleeing Central America and seeking asylum in the U.S. It is estimated that an unaccompanied child or family with young children only has a 1 in 10 chance of successfully avoiding deportation if they do not have legal representation. With an attorney, they have an 8 in 10 chance of being granted protection and staying in this country. Since almost all of these children and families could face potential death if deported, the stakes are very high for securing legal representation. Centro Legal is working to increase the number of children in crisis who receive life-saving legal representation and access to support services. The number of children and young families seeking services at our immigration clinics has tripled since January 2014. This is in addition to the high number of individuals being screened at immigration court. Centro Legal has been attempting to represent as many of these children and families as possible either in-house or through mentored pro bono representation. From June to September 2014, Centro Legal has provided legal consultations to over 300 children and families and agreed to provide free legal representation for nearly 120 unaccompanied children and/or young families. Unfortunately, Centro Legal does not have the resources, unless it receives additional funding, to continue to accept any of the hundreds of additional children and families in need of urgent legal representation. With additional funding, Centro Legal can provide legal representation to many more unaccompanied children and families with young children seeking asylum. Centro Legal can also help more children access attorneys by expanding its pro bono programs to include additional training for pro bono attorneys on representing children and young families before the federal immigration court and asylum office. By providing free legal representation, we can help children and families move forward from the horrible abuses they have suffered. For many of these children, they simply want a chance to live free from fear of death. They want the chance to go to school, make friends, and be happy. These are simple things that we often take for granted, but they are essential to lead a healthy and productive life. By legally representing these children and helping them avoid deportation, we can help them heal from their trauma and move forward.","As the scope and severity of the violence and gang activity in Central America has dramatically increased over the past seven months, so too has the number of young children and families seeking refuge in the U.S. Faced with severe violence and threats of death in their home countries, families are fleeing and desperate parents are sending children, as young as 3 years old, on the dangerous journey from Central America to the U.S. border alone. One child, Marta who is only 9 years old, traveled alone from Honduras to the U.S after being gang raped by gang members. Although Marta was able to travel with other immigrants, she had never met any of them prior to the journey. Similarly, Jose and Eduardo, 12 and 13 years old, traveled from Guatemala to the U.S. alone without parents or guardians to be reunited with their mother. Both Jose and Eduardo endured years of physical abuse, once they started to receive death threats they knew they had no choice but to flee Guatemala. It is clear that the urgency of the situation is exacerbated by the vulnerability of the population being impacted by the violence in Central America. Many of these children and families have fled severe sexual and physical violence. A large portion of them have been traumatized and harmed by gangs or authority figures due to being left without parental protection. Most, including the youngest of the asylum seekers, have been raped and almost all of the children and families have lived with death threats for much of their lives. Due to this large influx of unaccompanied children and young families, the number of individuals in removal proceedings has greatly increased. A child released from immigration detention is not given any legal orientation and, unless we act quickly, will likely not have legal representation in their deportation proceedings. These children and families do not fully understand the legal processes they are facing. If the child does not attend his or her court hearing, a deportation order will be entered in his or her absence. The consequences of this deportation can be fatal. Centro Legal is trying to represent as many of these children and families as possible either in house or through mentored pro bono representation. These children are coming to the U.S. because they often have familial ties here. They see the U.S. as a potential safe haven, where they don’t have to live in fear of being killed. These children all deserve the chance to live free from fear. If given the chance to heal and move forward, they could contribute greatly to our community. All they need is a chance to grow and thrive. At Centro Legal, we believe that all children have the right to grow up free from fear and abuse. We are doing everything we can to make sure that children are not sent home to face potential death.","Centro Legal Unaccompanied Minor Children Services Budget for One Year EXPENSES Personnel Senior Immigration Attorney 1 FTE 52,000.00 Immigration Staff Attorney 1 FTE 46,000.00 Benefits @ 16% 15,680.00 Total Personnel 113,680.00 OPERATIONS Computer Expense 1,000.00 Staff Travel (trips to immigration court, schools, churches, etc.) 2,000.00 Program Supplies (pens, paper, etc.) 1,500.00 Professional Liability Insurance 1,660.53 General Liability Insurance 1,328.42 Office Equipment (includes use of copy machine, postage machine) 1,275.28 Postage &amp; Shipping 797.05 Tech &amp; Database Support 488.19 Telecommunications (phone and internet) 900.67 Rent &amp; Utilities 8,608.17 Total Operations 19,558.32 Total 133,238.32 INCOME Committed Y&amp;H Soda Foundation 30,000.00 San Francisco Foundation 15,000.00 Law Firm Donor 30,000.00 Total Committed 75,000.00 Anticipated Latino Community Foundation 5,000.00 HIP Protect the Children Campaign 5,000.00 Individual Donors 48,238.32 Total Anticipated 58,238.32 Net Income 0.00","Founded in 1969, Centro Legal de la Raza in Oakland is a comprehensive legal service agency focused on strengthening low-income, immigrant, and Latino individuals and families by providing culturally competent legal representation, education, and advocacy.

Topics covered are healthy relationships, drug/alcohol prevention, violence prevention, social justice, Latino/a history, higher education/college access and youth empowerment. Our hope is to help students talk and deal with issues that may be obstacles to their education. SHIELD has a 3-prong approach to decreasing dropout rates and building a pipeline to academic success in higher education, career pathways and culture awareness. 1) Build leadership skills in the classroom, many times youth are not equipped with the skills to be a successful student. SHIELD will help bridge the gaps for many students with self-awareness, self development, and social awareness. 2) Community engagement, youth are not being exposed to the opportunities and resources the community can offer them. We bring guest speakers to our sessions and provide opportunities to go on field trips that are educational like visiting college campuses in the Bay Area, attend guest speaker seminars, conferences and other relevant events to connect them. 3) Strengthen parent involvement through various parent workshops and cafes that will touch on themes of behavior, higher education options, communication skills and navigating the school system. Traditionally, educational interventions target those youth at higher risk for failure or risky behavior. This deficit model focuses on the behaviors or characteristics that place youth at ­risk, such as failing grades, abusing drugs, or engagement in criminal behavior. SHIELD is designed to span the full range from prevention to intervention. SHIELD recognizes and builds upon the strong family bonds within the Latino community. The program will build upon the connections between youth, parents, extended family, and community members to form leadership skills that will in turn form stronger communities, and ultimately support academic success and family cohesiveness.","Although the graduation rates for Latino students in San Mateo county increased in the 2012-13 school year to 82% in the 2013-14 academic year it decreased by 3% and the drop-out rates for Latino students has gone up and is currently at 11%, whereas their white and asian counterparts has dropped. SHIELD will help Latino students who are at risk of failing and ultimately dropping out of high school. SHIELD is a year long program created to raise the graduation rates and also help steer the students to a pathway that will lead them to higher education and/or career pathway. We hope to engage youth in the SHIELD program to build a network that can support the program by giving back, building awareness, creating impact and establishing youth’s action plan for themselves and continue to be of service to others in their community, so there is a ripple effect. We will partner with the program, Friday Night Live, under the Youth Leadership Institute agency who we’ve built strong ties with over the years.

Our goal is to provide kids with a platform for which they can expand upon the discipline and goal-orientation needed to succeed in their academic and extra-curricular pursuits, while improving their health by increasing their knowledge of fitness and nutrition, and providing work-readiness training and college orientation that will increase educational attainment and earning potential. &nbsp; Youth within Little Village are in dire need of comprehensive out-of-school time mentorship that engages them in planning for their future academic and personal success. Youth who are not given a pro-active path toward positive goals often turn to drug abuse and gang violence. CYBC is dedicated to using boxing as the platform for building trusting relationships and empowering youth, ultimately producing long-term sustainable change within a community that suffers. Through support, together we can encourage youth to pursue healthy behaviors that lead to long-term community sustainability. Funding CYBC would directly support our three major programs, (1) the Coach-Mentoring program that approaches violence prevention by teaching young people the basics of physical fitness, mental focus and discipline, the art of boxing, and teamwork, (2) the Health and Wellness program that engages youth through 1: 1 conversations with coach-mentors in practices that are age-appropriate for their personal nutrition and fitness goals, and (3) the college preparatory program that supports goal setting and planning for all youth; ultimately harboring the necessary confidence and life skills for academic success. This program includes the resume development, scholarship assistance, tools for applying for college, and university visits.","CYBC is physically located in Little Village. Youth face barriers to academic and professional achievement due to poverty, low-performing schools, and systemic disadvantage. Youth attend schools with some of the highest drop-out rates in the city, and oftentimes come from non-professional backgrounds. The community is divided into east and west by two gangs: the Latin Kings and the Two-Six. High incidence of gang violence in Little Village means that youth can be socialized into negative behaviors if not given alternative outlets for constructive activity. Gang lines make it difficult for youth to traverse freely across the community to access park and recreation space. Youth within Little Village are in dire need of comprehensive after-school mentorship that engages them in planning for their future academic and personal success. Youth who are not given a pro-active path toward positive goals often turn to drug abuse and gang violence. CYBC’s Programming targets inner-city youth who are consistently drawn to the image of physical toughness that the sport of boxing conveys. A study funded by LISC Chicago and distributed by Enlace Chicago last year indicated that 61% of youth in South Lawndale reported they had been attacked with a weapon, and 71% reported they were attacked without a weapon. Additionally, 42% were victims of gang violence; 57% witnessed domestic violence; 74% had heard gun shots, bombs going off, or street riots; and an astonishing 86% witnessed someone else being attacked with a weapon. Additionally, 54% of youth reported that the people of their neighborhood could not be trusted. Physical strength appeals to youth growing up in areas with high rates of gang violence where they are often exposed to random street violence and threats to their physical safety. Survival skills are a priority for youth growing up in this context, and being able to protect oneself and gain the respect of peers is a key survival strategy. However, youth who enter the CYBC boxing gym quickly learn that our purpose is to socialize them into a different type of environment that functions as a safe haven focused on discipline, excellence, honor, service to others, and respect for your opponent. Furthermore, the same study by LISC indicated that 55% of youth participants in 5th- 8th grade have had something stolen from them, 50% of youth have been hit or beat up by a sibling or someone in their home, only 20% of youth receive A’s in school, 60% of youth reported that they are not confident about handling problems in their future, and 60% of youth reported that if another student hit them first, their family would want them to fight back, despite the potential consequences enforced by their school’s discipline code. Youth who enter the program with the mentality of &#8220;wanting to learn to fight&#8221; must shift to &#8220;wanting to build the skill, strength, and focus to succeed at any challenge.&#8221; CYBC teaches youth that boxing is not about learning how to throw a punch, but about learning how to face adversity and not lose focus&#8211;a crucial lesson in life that resonates profoundly with at-risk youth. Boxing is one of the most effective forms of engaging youth in learning life skills because it instills values regarding positive change in areas such as health, teamwork, and facing adversity. CYBC hopes to use boxing as a platform for engaging youth, allowing young Latino men to utilize the life skills they&#8217;ve acquired, such as discipline, respect, and work-ethic, to edify the community around. CYBC has ongoing measurement tools that include mental health and wellness assessments, attendance and retention tracking, nutritional education pre-and post tests, and PACER tests that measure and quantify the physical accomplishments and improvements of youth for a complete calendar year.","$2,000 allotted for covering the cost of approximately 50 additional youth members. $1,500 for Boxing Equipment including (new Heavy Bag, 30 additional pairs of gloves, speed bags, jump ropes, new mirrors, etc) $1,500 to help cover cost of two coaches for nne year. (CYCB receives coaches through Coach Across America and pays a portion of their salary. Coach Across America covers approximately 3/4 the cost of hiring a coach for a year.)",,"CYBC’s nonprofit sports-based youth development programming has been operating in Chicago’s South Lawndale (also known as Little Village) community since 2006 and is the only independent boxing program in Chicago dedicated to comprehensive youth engagement. Programming includes three elements structured around six core values: discipline, unity, education, health, service, and leadership. Program elements include 1. Daily boxing instruction with licensed youth development coach-mentors 2. Health/nutrition education, and 3. College orientation and work readiness training. These pro-active elements of programming are what the organization believes to be the most prevalent form of violence-prevention for youth ages 8 and up within South Lawndale. CYBC’s Coach-Mentorship program approaches violence prevention by teaching youth the fundamentals of physical conditioning, mental focus and discipline, boxing technique, and teamwork while also building leadership skills. The Coach-Mentorship program additionally includes classes that teach stress and anxiety management, and amplifies awareness of social identity and the intersection of cultural influence needed to propagate healthy behavior in community involvement. CYBC’s Health and Wellness program engages youth through 1:1 conversations with coach-mentors on nutrition practices appropriate to their age and fitness goals. CYBC addresses nutritional deficiencies within South Lawndale through a two-fold approach that includes increasing the frequency and quality of physical activity among youth and families, and educating youth and families about nutritional and affordable eating behaviors. CYBC’s College and Career Readiness Program supports goal setting and planning for all youth, in order that they would have the confidence and life skills necessary to obtain educational success.

Since its inception in 1985, the gardens have been a place to share the Puerto Rican experience with local children and families, most of whom shared similar stories of displacement. As a gathering space for community members and an outdoor classroom for youth, Las Parcelas is a beacon of hope, and the center of culture for a community facing the impacts of gentrification.","In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the Norris Square neighborhood was riddled with drugs, gang violence and escalated racial tensions. Since its beginnings, NSNP had used several gardens as outdoor classroom spaces for local youth. Most programming occurred on lots that were borrowed by NSNP, but later lost when they were sold or reclaimed. Iris Brown, the former Garden and Cultural Coordinator for NSNP had a dream of finding a vacant lot for a more permanent garden. Brown found a vacant trash filled lot on the 2200 block of North 2nd Street. Norris Square Neighborhood Project organized the parents of the after school youth to clean the lot and make a garden. This garden was built in 1982 and named Raices. Brown felt that it was important to have a place dedicated to the exploration of Puerto Rican roots that were commonly shared by most within the Norris Square community. After the transformation of the vacant lot on 2nd street, NSNP and community members envisioned more gardens in the neighborhood which eventually became Las Parcelas and Colobo. Las Parcelas, the core garden for NSNP and for the neighborhood is a canvas representing the cultural roots of the community, beauty of urban gardening, and creative voice of youth. Filled with found objects and hand-crafted wooden furniture, Las Parcelas is a piece of Puerto Rico in the middle of North Philadelphia, as well as a symbol of community members uniting to end the blight that plagued the neighborhood. The revitalization of Las Parcelas will ensure that a legacy continues and that community members have a place to celebrate culture, participate in food production, build friendships, promote creativity. As we rebuild Las Parcelas, we rebuild a community.","Category TotalMaterials $ 1,200Printing $ 100Events $ 200Staff $ 3,000Administration $ 500Total$ 5,000 Budget Details Materials: Wood for raised beds (renovations to 15 raised beds) Paint: 5 gallons Wood for benches / planters Seedling (ornamentals) Seeds (at least 10 varieties of seeds) Printing: Use of printer for promotional materials for the gardens.

Our mission is to promote positive change through youth education, community leadership, green spaces, the arts and the celebration of Latino culture.","NSNP reaches the community through the individual child. Our theory of community change is that by focusing on a child, he or she will affect change in his or her life, his or her house, and then expand to the school, block, street and eventually, the community. Through this change process, we have been able to affect positive change in generations of community residents. In order to bring this spirit of youth-driven change within the organization as well, we have increased youth decision-making within our programs and program design, as youth from kindergarten to the twelfth grade contribute to the development of program activities on an age-appropriate scale. An integral part of the NSNP programming is providing a small program model in which a familial environment exists between staff (most of whom are community members), youth, and other community members. We value the individualized attention and relationships instructors engage in with youth and the positive influence this has on youth development and educational advancement. Many youth have taken this mentoring and support to become mentors, themselves. We have hired program participants as staff members and interns, and we have worked with older youth to prepare them for board service. Our history began on the 2100 block of North Howard Street, in the West Kensington section of North Philadelphia, in 1973, when a local fifth grade teacher and a professor at Eastern University founded NSNP. The two women collaborated with volunteer teachers, artists and community residents to create an educational center that was culturally relevant to, and protective of, the children living in a section of Philadelphia that was notorious for its deadly drug culture. Our work has grown in scope as the predominantly Latino community around us has expanded. Our environmental and cultural education programs have helped transform the community and the lives of Latino Norris Square residents.

It&#8217;s a troubling fact that Latinos earn lower grades on average than their white peers and are much more likely to drop out of high school (Stanford University). In Durham, 35% of all Latinos live in poverty (Partnership for a Healthy Durham, 2013). In North Carolina, almost half of all Latino children under the age of 5 live in poverty, and Latino children are more than twice as likely to live in poverty as white children &#8211; 41% compared to 14.4%, respectively (US Census Bureau, 2014). In 2011-12, 23.5% of Durham Public Schools students were Latino, an increase from 8.9% in 2003-04. However, In 2008-09, 80% of US Latino fourth graders were not reading proficiently, compared to 68% of all fourth graders. The number of Latino children, ages 0 to 18, in Durham has grown substantially, increasing 172% over the last decade (Durham’s Partnership for Children, 2012). In 2012, and in 2009-10, 36% of children entering kindergarten in Durham identified as Hispanic/Latino (Kindergarten Health Assessment, 2010).","Seventy-seven percent of Latino children in North Carolina live in immigrant families (Action for Children NC, 2010), which presents language and cultural barriers for these families. In North Carolina, 69.4% of foreign-born Spanish speakers older than age 5 have Limited English Proficiency (LEP). Additionally, a figure higher than any other immigrant group, 31% of NC Spanish-speaking households are linguistically isolated, 8,240 students of the Durham Public Schools speak Spanish at home (DPS). Durham Latino families are in need of additional support to ensure their children’s academic success due to economic insecurity, language and cultural barriers, low education levels, lack of health insurance, lack of knowledge and familiarity with existing services, fear and distrust of official institutions and lack of culturally and linguistically appropriate programs for communities of color.

For this reason, persecution based on sexual orientation or gender identity became legal grounds for asylum in the U.S. in 1994. There are thousands of LGBT refugees and asylum seekers living right here in the San Francisco Bay Area. Our fiscal sponsor and partner organization, East Bay Sanctuary Covenant (EBSC), successfully assists 300 LGBT adults per year in the process of legal asylum, almost all from Latin America. These individuals have directly experienced persecution, in the forms of physical and sexual violence, harassment, threats, social ostracism (from family, schools, churches, etc.), and/or job and housing discrimination. Our program exists in order to address the emotional needs of LGBT refugees, who bring with them all the traumas that they have experienced in their countries of origin. Rainbow Community Support Project offers three weekend retreats per year focused on community building and healing trauma within the LGBT Latino immigrant community. We also offer shorter workshops through local agencies serving the same population. Our events are offered at a nominal fee with no one turned away for lack of funds. All programs are offered in Spanish and incorporate holistic healing methods, such as music, art, and meditation. Through our programs, we foster self-acceptance, self-care, and emotional well-being within the LGBT Latino immigrant community.","Rainbow Community Support Project believes that all people who seek refuge in the U.S. due to homophobia and transphobia deserve access to affordable and effective mental health care and community support. Violence on the basis of sexual orientation and gender leave long lasting, traumatic effects on the individuals who experience it.

While the unaccompanied minor crisis has fallen out of the media spotlight, hundreds of migrant children and families from Central America and Mexico continue to arrive in the United States seeking protection. Ongoing violence propels children, including many young men and boys, to make the treacherous journey to the U.S. alone without a parent or guardian. Most of these migrant children are escaping violence and abuse. Young men are particularly vulnerable because they often experience intense pressure to join a gang in their home country or face death. Centro Legal is providing EMERGENCY IMMIGRATION LEGAL SERVICES to unaccompanied minors because we believe all children deserve to be safe from violence. With legal protection, these boys and young men can find a safe haven, begin to heal, and embark on a brighter future. While every child deserves protection from violence, they also deserve a quality education and a meaningful professional career. This can be particularly challenging for Latino boys. Barriers such as under-resourced schools, undocumented status, and poverty can make it difficult for them to succeed in college and obtain a professional career. Centro Legal&#8217;s YOUTH LAW ACADEMY provides long-term support to Latino young men so they can excel in college and a professional career. Through offering a challenging curriculum, professional mentorship, and exposure to the field of law, our goal is to develop the next generation of Latino attorneys and leaders. Every day, we are inspired by the strength and resilience of the Latino boys and young men we serve. We know that with accessible and meaningful support and resources they can heal from violence and overcome barriers to college and careers. Your donation to Centro Legal will support 1) emergency legal services that protect unaccompanied minors who have survived violence, and 2) academic and career development programming in the Youth Law Academy that helps young men achieve their college and career dreams.","Centro Legal is dedicated to the well-being and success of all Latino men and boys in our community&#8212;from migrant children who have just arrived to Latino youth who have lived in our community for years or even generations. Protecting our Children from Violence Through our comprehensive immigration services, we are protecting the rights of some of the most vulnerable boys and men in our community&#8212;unaccompanied minors who have suffered violence and recently arrived in the United States. In 2014, intensified gang violence in Central America led to a surge of unaccompanied minors arriving in the United States. Among those fleeing for their lives were thousands of boys and young men. Centro Legal continues to be a leader in the fight to protect these refugee children by providing them with emergency legal services. We have helped hundreds of migrant boys and young men connect with a qualified and caring attorney who can help them navigate the complicated immigration system in order to obtain immigration relief and no longer live in fear. Most of these boys are survivors of sexual and physical violence; many have been traumatized by gangs. These children need emergency legal services, as well other basic services to help them heal from their trauma and have stable, healthy lives. Thanks to our dedicated staff, Centro Legal connects these boys with free mental health and medical services, and emergency housing and food. To end the cycle of violence, it is critical that these boys and young men receive culturally-competent legal services. We are committed to finding innovative ways to bring peace and hope into the lives of these boys. This July, we launched a summer program focused on providing activities to help foster personal growth and mental health. Program activities include art, photography, and soccer as well as ESL and college workshops to help them prepare for their future. Through this program, these young men and boys can build self-esteem, establish friendships, and become empowered members of our community. Centro Legal continues to work tirelessly to defend the rights of these boys and young men because we believe all children deserve to be safe from violence. We are firmly committed to the notion that all children have the right to access an attorney to protect them from further harm. Helping young men succeed in college and professional careers To end poverty in the Latino community, Latino youth need long-term academic and emotional support to succeed in college and enter into a professional career. For many Latino students, limited-English skills, limited education of parents, and family pressure to work rather than attend college are all factors that aggravate their ability to graduate from high school and enroll in college or law school. For undocumented students, the constant fear of deportation causes stress that inhibits their success in school and also limits their potential for pursuing professional careers. In addition, young Latino men also have to fight against particular stereotypes and prejudices, which can make their journey into adulthood even more difficult. Centro Legal’s Youth Law Academy (YLA) provides individualized support to Latino youth in Oakland so they can excel in college and in a professional career. The YLA specializes in serving immigrant youth and Latino students who are the first in their family to attend college. We provide low-income students with intensive college preparation, professional mentorship, hands-on experience in the field of law, and financial aid resources. We connect undocumented students with immigration services and help them apply for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) or other forms of immigration relief. Our vision is to help Latino men and boys build the self-esteem and confidence they need to achieve a higher education and a legal career so they can become empowered leaders capable of giving back to their community. We measure progress in achieving our goals of creating a better future for Latino young men and boys in two ways. First, our immigration attorneys track the number of: 1) young men and boys who receive full legal representation, secure asylum, and/or other forms of immigration relief; 2) the number of young men and boys who are connected to mental health and youth development services; and 3) pro bono attorneys we are able to recruit to assist us with these immigration cases. Second, our Youth Law Academy staff tracks high school graduation and college acceptance rates and college enrollment and completion rates. They also use student surveys, informal student feedback, academic performance, and SAT scores to make sure these young men are on track to meet their personal goals of attending college and becoming a professional. Key indicators that let us know whether we are reaching our goals include the number of unaccompanied boys we are able to help obtain asylum or Special Immigrant Juvenile Status and the number of young Latino men we help enroll in and graduate from college and transition to a legal career.","Centro Legal de la Raza: Latino Men and Boys Project Program Budget: July 1, 2015 &#8211; June 30, 2016 EXPENSES Personnel Youth Law Academy Program Director @ 50% FTE 31,000.00 Youth Law Academy Program Coordinator @50% FTE 22,000.00 Immigration Program Director, 25% FTE 15,500.00 Unaccompanied Minor Staff Attorney, 50% FTE 25,500.00 Unaccompanied Minor Staff Attorney, 50% FTE 25,000.00 Unaccompanied Minor Staff Attorney, 50% FTE 24,000.00 Unaccompanied Minor Paralegal, 50% FTE 20,000.00 Children Services Coordinator, 50% FTE 25,000.00 Intake Specialist 25% FTE 7,800.00 Executive Director, 10% FTE 7,900.00 Development Associate @ 10% FTE 4,800.00 Benefits @ 18% 37,530.00 Total Personnel 246,030.00 Operations Computer Expense 691.95 Princeton Review 2,475.00 Dues &amp; Subscriptions 1,113.29 Insurance 6,851.03 Meeting Expense 479.57 Training Supplies &amp; Materials 1,695.00 Office Equipment 2,569.14 Office Supplies 2,055.31 Postage &amp; Shipping 4,500.00 Printing &amp; Duplication 500 Professional Development 513.83 Rent &amp; Utilities 18,669.05 Tech Support 770.74 Telecommunications 1,370.21 Travel (includes Youth Transportation) 3,000.00 Total Operations 47,254.12 Subtotal 293,284.12 Administration @ 10% 29,328.41 TOTAL EXPENSES 322,612.53 INCOME COMMITTED Isabel Allende Foundation 15-16 5,000.00 Alameda County UAC Funding 2015 12,500.00 Oakland UAC Funding 15-16 67,250.00 State of California UAC Funding 2015 82,000.00 City of Oakland Fund for Children &amp; Youth 50,000.00 Total Committed 216,750.00 PENDING AND/OR ANTICIPATED Foundations San Francisco Foundation 12,500.00 Y &amp; H Soda Foundation 25,000.00 Zellerbach Foundation 25,000.00 Bernard E &amp; Alba Witkin Foundation 2,500.00 East Bay College Access Network 9,500.00 California Bar Foundation 10,000.00 Morris Stulsaft Foundation 7,500.00 Total Foundations 92,000.00 HIP Give Donations 10,000.00 Individual Donations 3,862.53 Total Pending and Anticipated 105,862.53 TOTAL INCOME 322,612.53 NET INCOME 0 Centro Legal de la Raza Organization budget July 1, 2015 &#8211; June 30, 2016: $2,147,623.85",,"For 46 years, Oakland’s Centro Legal de la Raza has provided culturally-competent services to the Bay Area’s low-income Latino and immigrant communities.

Our objective is to ensure that young students understand and use technology in full capacity. The project Programming my future aims to reach out to disadvantaged students that wouldn’t have the opportunity to learn programming. We aim to impact students in the following ways: Develop the skills of the future: When students learn to code, it enables them to learn other things. As when students learn to read, they then read to learn, the same thing happens with coding. Students will learn to code, and code to learn. Make school more relevant: When students learn new concepts through programming, they learn them in a meaningful relevant context. Students have to learn new concepts that they immediately apply them in their projects. That is the best way to learn. Positively influence their decisions: 20% of students drop out in middle school and 40% in high schools. One of the main reasons is that students find school content irrelevant and far from their daily lives and activities. We are teaching students computer skills that where relevant 15 years ago. Besides the obvious negative impacts of dropping out before finishing high school, unemployment is leading many students to turn to organized crime for business opportunities. Time magazine recently labeled them the “Mexico’s lost youth”.

It is located approximately 70 kms away from the capital city, in San Martín Jilotepeque, a town located in Chimaltenango. Even though it is relatively a short distance, this town is away from all industry and technology breakthroughs. Undoubtedly, its&#8217; 491 students have not had the opportunity to access technology, due to their lack of resources. We want to break the paradigm that technology is not for everyone and that children, such as the students of this school, can have access to this wonderful educational tool, which will expand their horizons and will present them a new world full of possibilities. We want to transform the access to technology into a right, not a privilege. With technology inside a classroom, this children will have the chance to acquire the minimum competencies and skills they need to face today&#8217;s highly advanced world. Then, tomorrow they will become part of the important workforce that moves Guatemala. To achieve this we need a total of US$5000. With this money we will equip the Carlos Castillo Armas School with a computer lab.

We firmly believe that an advanced nation is shaped by educated people, but in Guatemala there still a lot to do in this matter. This effort to equip all public schools in the country with technology, and train teachers in the usage of this tool inside the classroom, is a step in the right direction. Today children face a world much more demanding and competitive. We must provide them a different type of education, an education 2.0, which will allow them to face the world in a different way and to move forward. This would, in principle, open their minds into a whole new world, full of possibilities. It would expand their horizons early on, so their curiosity and desire of knowledge. But, most importantly, this children will realize that education is the most valuable tool they have to succeed. For this reason, the foundation provides sustained accompaniment throughout the process. It trains teachers into using technology inside the classroom and how to make the most of it. Besides, the school is exposed to a constant monitoring and evaluation, that helps determine their strengths and weaknesses.

Therefore, FunSEPA's objective is to improve the education quality in Guatemala, through the innovative use of technology as an educational tool. FunSEPA has changed the day-to-day experience and the future opportunities for teachers and children in over 1,200 public schools in Guatemala.

Latinos represent almost a quarter of the aging population in California and it is projected to account by 2050 for almost 40% of those aged 60 and over. As the number of aging Latinos continue to grow, it is important that we work towards improving the quality of life for aging Latinos, and equally important is the ability for nonprofits to address their issues.

Your donation will help with the cost associated with CANAL’s first organizational and advocacy planning retreat to be held in Sacramento, January 24-26, 2016. CANAL’s organizational and advocacy planning retreat will offer a unique opportunity to highlight the current challenges faced by aging Latinos across California with the goal to create a working plan to being addressing these needs. The retreat will focus on two core areas: (1) organizational planning to build a broader movement; and (2) identify CANAL’s advocacy priorities.","The report, The Latino Age Wave: What Changing Ethnic Demographics Mean for the Future of Aging in the United States, released by HIP examined the challenges and opportunities faced by a growing Latino older adult population. The assessment found that a majority of federally funded aging agencies were unable to serve a Spanish-speaking client upon first contact. The national infrastructure has an established expertise for serving a mainstream, primarily white population, but is not prepared for Latinos. On the other hand, hundreds of Latino community-based organizations are already serving Latino adults, but may not have the resources to do so in a way that addresses the specific needs of older Latinos or on a sufficiently large scale. HIP’s research on older Latinos found that while some older Latino adults seek organizations that specialize on aging, Latinos largely flock to one-stop-shop organizations that service the entire family. CANAL strongly believes that it’s important for funders, community organizations, service providers, and policymakers to work together to develop policies and an infrastructure that leverages the assets of networks so that each can have the capacity to serve a Latino older adult population.","Budget: $6, 500 Travel Expenses for Coalition Partners (flights, hotel, meeting rooms) $1,500 Strategic Plan Facilitator $2,000 Marking and Print",,"In 2013, through a grant from The Atlantic Philanthropies, The California Wellness Foundation and The SCAN Foundation, Hispanics in Philanthropy (HIP) launched the California Latino Age Wave Initiative (CALAWI) to strengthen Latino aging programs and advocacy efforts in California where the Latino older adult population is large and growing. HIP provided funding to six Latino serving organization and leaders working in California to: Raise awareness and support for Latino aging issues among key stakeholders including funders, policy-makers, and institutional and community leaders. Increase the net amount of philanthropic dollars flowing to Latino aging issues. Expand and improve programs and advocacy efforts that address aging issues in Latino communities. Engage more Latino older adults as advocates for policies that improve the economic health and well-being of Latino elders. The Latino Age Wave Initiative drew upon the promising practices, gaps, and recommendations identified in HIP’s recent Latino Age Wave report (The Latino Age Wave: What Changing Ethnic Demographics Mean for the Future of Aging in the United States) to develop strategies and meaningful programming for aging Latinos. Over the two years, funded organizations worked to develop their internal capacity, raise awareness of Latino aging issues and worked towards creating a unified and powerful voice in support of public policy that improves the quality of life of aging Latinos. At the culmination of the two-year project in 2015, HIP CALAWI grantees unanimously agreed to form a statewide advocacy network, California Advocacy Network for Aging Latinos (CANAL), to continue with the above framework, build on the momentum developed to shape public policy, and to continue to raise an awareness issues impacting older Latinos.

Help us raise funds for the installation of a small attention center to provide legal advice and support to migrant women and adolescent youth!,"Our objective is to install an advisory and legal services center for women, adolescents and migrant girls in Comitán de Domínguez along the Chiapas-Guatemala border. Reaching our financial goal will allow us to cover a year&#8217;s worth of program implementation. Due to lack of infrastructure and human resources, there has been little follow up on migrant cases along the Chiapas-Guatemalan border. Our new legal services center will allow us to directly attend to cases and provide a safe space for women who have had their human rights violated. The most important challenge is demonstrating the level of violations of human rights in the migration corridor of Comitan, Chiapas &#8211; Huehuetenango, Guatemala and start providing legal response to human rights violations, with the hope that more women and girls dare to speak out and authorities become more responsive and uphold migrant rights without extortion. Over the years many migration institutions have lost their credibility due to internal corruption and migrant extorsion. This center will provide a reliable, safe alternative for women and youth to receive legal services and counseling.","Between 2000 and 2011, 776 women migrants filed complaints against federal authorities for violations of their human rights. Sixty-eight percent of those were against the National Migration Institute; 7% against the Attorney General of the Republic and 4% against the Federal Preventive Police and the Federal Police, according to Information of the National Commission of Human Rights. We chose a territory known as an important point on the migratory path between Mexico and Guatemala. We have the opportunity to respond to the demands of women who are unaware of their human rights and are often abused by their status as migrants or returnees, and often do not dare to denounce human rights abuses or at least to seek information about the rights. For this reason we are interested in providing direct services to those affected and provide accompaniment and legal advice for their cases, so that they may be more informed and recognize their rights. FOCA will provide a safe and supportive space to meet the needs of women, adolescents and children in migration.","Presupuesto para el Proyecto Lista de necesidades para la instalación del espacio de atención a mujeres migrantes.

At Neighbors Link Stamford we offer ESL classes and other activities to keep our day workers learning, and socializing in a safe and warm environment. For the upcoming winter season, we want to offer the day laborers a different opportunity, a series of art workshops where they can be introduced to art as a powerful means of expression, which is a new experience for most of them. The project consists of four painting classes, of 2.5 hours each, for the day laborers (94% of our day laborers at NLS are Ltinos), free of charge and to include lunch and all materials. In each class,t he instructor will show a finished painting and the students will replicate it following step-by-step instructions. Each of the four paintings will include icons of both the Latin America and the United States, to foster the healthy integration of both groups. When the workshops are finished, there will be a two-day community integration project in which the art students, the rest of the day laborers, and their sons, will create a community mural together with the police officers from the Stamford Police Department. This six-hour activity, will promote a better relationship and understanding between the police and our mostly Latino workers and young boys. The entire project will end with an art show and unveiling ceremony at Neighbors Link Stamford, with the participation of the larger community. &nbsp;","The first part of the project aims to provide our local workers with an opportunity for enrichment during a time of the year when day jobs are scarce, while further integrating them with the NLS community. We want to show them that art transcends language and cultures and that it can be a powerful form of expression. As the second part of this project, we are joining efforts with our local police department to paint a community mural. We want to offer our workers an opportunity to interact with police officers in a collaborative environment, working together to build relationships of trust and respect between them. These two days of mural painting will be offered to our day workers and their sons. For the third part of the project, the participants in the art workshops will be invited to present their artwork at an unveiling ceremony for the community mural. The community at large will be invited, in order to increase awareness of our local day laborer center and the importance of a healthy relationship between the Latino community (in particular men and young boys) and our police force.","Budget Art Workshop &#8211; $3250 $2100 materials for 60 students $280 materials for instructors $544 lunch for 68 people (15 students and 2 instructors per class) $326 for admin fees, marketing, etc Community Mural with Stamford Police Department &#8211; $2250 $1100 for paint $700 for brushes, cups, tape, wooden panels, stain, etc. $250 for refreshments for 2 days of painting $200 for admin fees, marketing, etc. Mural unveiling ceremony and art show $1000 for unveiling ceremony and art show, marketing, administrative, etc. Our organization&#8217;s size is $550,000.",,"Neighbors Link Stamford’s purpose is to strengthen the whole community by actively enhancing the healthy integration of immigrants.

We are on fire to put qualifying immigrants on the pathway to citizenship and to send youth to college and qualify them to work! This campaign will help ¡HICA! mobilize in the communities through Central Alabama to offer information sessions about Naturalization and DACA. ¡HICA!’s bilingual, bicultural immigration attorney and Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) accredit staff members work with local grassroots organizations to gather small or large groups for these information session. It’s not just information—we are ready to help families apply. Your donation will give us the funds we need to get out of Birmingham and get into the communities.

They come from low-income families who do not have educational backgrounds and do not have the possibilities of investing high amounts of money on education since their first priority is to feed themselves by any means.

They succeeded during these two years attending both our program and their public schools. They have learned how to manage time, work hard, and another language. After these two years of learning beyond what public schools teach, it is a necessary for them to finish what they started. Attending university will be their rewards. They decided to study Aviation Maintenance because they have the abilities and interests on this subject, also for the job market on this career. We are sure that they have potential to succeed in this carreer path. They have demonstrated their capacity because they are part of the top of their classes in their schools.

It has five training centers in El Salvador which are located in Santa Ana, Ahuachapán, San Miguel, Chalatenango and San Salvador. After our students graduate from our classes, we grant them scholarships to attend the university. Since our budget is limted, we can give scholarships specifically up to $2,000 per year. This amount of money helps us to pay the tuitions, fees, and in some cases transportation. If a student needs to move from their communities so that they can study their major in other other cities, we cannot provide that amount of money. The student needs to gather the necessary amount to cover room and board. In this case, they cannot afford it, and they cannot study near their houses since they don´t have universities nearby.

Community members often feel powerless to improve a system in which students of several grades copy from a single board, teacher attendance is abysmal, and school bookshelves are pretty well empty. But Un Mundo’s Literacy Connections program empowers people in these communities to transform their own educational opportunities — by training local citizens to teach literacy workshops, lead book clubs, invent dynamic story-time activities, and even perform literacy-themed community theater. We utilize interactive pedagogical strategies and constant feedback collection to bring both children and adults a rich, highly effective learning experience. Moreover, Literacy Connections goes beyond reading and writing; the program energizes people to take an active role in the education of their neighbors. Through multifaceted programming in communities throughout the Cangrejal River Valley, Un Mundo has been building a network of skilled, intrinsically motivated literacy promoters for several years, and our work is far from over. We currently facilitate literacy activities in five communities, and we hope to expand the program to reach the majority of the 8,000 people in need throughout the valley by 2020. We’ll provide books, trainings, professional support, and passion for learning wherever we go, and we’ll measure advances in reading and writing skills with each step along the way. Our goal to continue raising literacy levels in rural Honduran communities by cultivating a thriving system of educators and learners won’t be possible without the support of many devoted partners like you. Your contributions help to fund trainings, purchase educational materials, and make community transformation possible. Please consider becoming a partner by making a donation to Un Mundo’s Literacy Connections project today!","In rural communities, Hondurans too often feel: isolated, due to poor infrastructure and scant resources, dehumanized, because of misconceptions about the capabilities of rural people, and powerless, thanks to corrupt and broken systems that provide few opportunities to move forward. All of Un Mundo&#8217;s projects, and perhaps our educational projects in particular, are about yanking these problems up by the root and promoting: community, through which people trust and work with one another to solve common problems, dignity, a pride in oneself, one&#8217;s community, and one&#8217;s valuable way of life, and self-sufficiency, the realization that, together, we have all we need to reach our shared goals. While we work hard to measure concrete objectives such as improving children&#8217;s reading skills, we also spend a lot of time talking to community members and using qualitative methods to affirm that we&#8217;re meeting these intangible but indispensable broader goals.","Our Literacy Connections budget for 2016 includes: &nbsp; In-Office Trainings (1/mo.) 800 Field Observations and Support (1/mo.) 1,200 Educator Stipends 5,488 Student Evaluations 1000 Educator Evaluations 500 Teaching Materials 1,920 Books 2,400 Snacks/Meals 1,440 Transportation 1,040 Other Administrative Costs 1,000 Total $16,788 &nbsp; Un Mundo’s total budget for 2016 is approximately $110,000.",,,ended,20151125.0,unmundo_hn,

Family incomes need the additional contribution generated by a child, and they drop out of school when they reach age 12. Their future after that is precarious. They are destined to become poorly qualified and underpaid workers. They suffer from a quality of life far below minimal standards and find few opportunities to escape poverty. They are in constant danger of falling into crime and drug addiction.All children deserve the chance to grow and develop their capabilities and potential.

Colectiva Legal del Pueblo uses community organizing and legal services strategies to strengthen undocumented communities to defend themselves from deportation and detention and transform the broken immigration system. We are seeking funding for our legal services for detainees who are organizing within the Northwest Detention Center. On March 7, 2014, the first of a series of ongoing hunger strikes began at Northwest Detention Center (NWDC) in Tacoma, WA began. Leaders within the detention center had convinced over 1200 detainees to stop eating and demand better food, an end to their economic exploitation within the center, better medical care, and an end to deportations. Detainees and their families reached out to Colectiva Legal del Pueblo for assistance with notifying the public about the strike and organizing support for strikers. Our project formed in response. In this project we work with Colectivo de Detenidos, a collective of detainees inside NWDC, as well as their families and allies on the outside, to apply pressure to ICE, DHS, and the federal government to reform the detention and deportation system. Colectivo de Detenidos won the Seattle Human Rights Commission’s 2014 Human Rights Award for their courageous organizing in demanding more humane conditions inside the detention center even in the face of intimidation and retaliation. We work with Colectivo members and their families on their cases, believing that if we can get them released, they will be powerful and strategic organizers for immigration reform.","The root cause of deportations is our broken immigration system. Our government has failed millions of undocumented immigrants by not granting us a humane immigration reform with a quick path to citizenship. Our current government puts people in detention centers, taxes them, and allows private detention centers to profit from their suffering and from family separation. Our undocumented community is being attacked and dehumanized because of their status. Corporations are allowed to cross borders but people are not allowed to cross borders. As undocumented immigrants we have been told to be silent about our status, to fear the police and ICE, to let our allies do the work for us and to speak for us because it is too risky to fight for our community ourselves. We want to make sure our community feels empowered and to make sure they lose the fear of breaking the silence. Our work will help end the fear created by ICE within the undocumented community, by empowering our community with knowledge about their rights, and the strength of their collective power. Now President Obama has announced his executive action to extend Deferred Action, replace Secure Communities, increase border enforcement, and revamp prosecutorial discretion memos. Many of the members of Colectivo de Detenidos will not be eligible for deferred action under the new executive order because they do not have children, or have DUIs, or other reasons.

Upon Pres. Obama’s announcement of his executive action on immigration reform, we have begun to develop and advertise workshops advising community members on what it means for them and their families. We also provide legal advocacy and support to people detained in the Northwest Detention Center (NWDC). We have also actively engaged in the National Day Laborers Organizing Network’s (NDLON) Not1More campaign. We have collaborated with el Colectivo de Detenidos inside the NWDC and with their families on the outside of the detention center to conduct peaceful demonstrations such as marches, fasts, civil disobedience, and encampments outside the detention center, helped to highlight the organizing and demands of detainees in the media, and met with lawmakers such as Rep. Adam Smith and with WA State Gov. Inslee’s office, in order to build pressure for comprehensive immigration reform and an end to oppression based on immigration status.

In addition, this project is important not only as an additional effort (from those efforts carried out so far) to benefit the unaccompanied immigrant children, but as a new collaboration effort trying to scale and support current local efforts and strategic actions. Challenges: Lack of legal advice available to children and youths, cost to initiate litigation and time are the huge challenges for this vulnerable group, because sometimes the repatriation looks to be the only alternative for them without knowing the risk that may represent to be repatriated because they will go back to their home countries (mainly Central American countries such as: Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador) to the same situation that make them migrate. Sometimes unaccompanied children and youths prefer to be repatriated in order to retry their intent to cross the Mexican border (even when each cross represents more risk), before staying for weeks or months detained during the process.

Desafíos: la falta de asesoramiento jurídico a disposición de los niños y jóvenes, el costo para iniciar un litigio y el tiempo (tendrían que estar detenidos por un largo periodo), son los grandes retos que enfrenta este grupo vulnerable ya que, en muchas ocasiones, la repatriación parece ser la única alternativa para ellos. En este sentido no se toma en cuenta el riesgo que puede representar ser repatriados ya que van a volver a sus países de origen (principalmente los países centroamericanos como: Guatemala, Honduras y El Salvador) a la misma situación que los hizo migrar (huir de violencia, persecución, o soledad porque sus padres ya migraron a los EEUU). A veces los niños no acompañados y jóvenes prefieren ser repatriados con la intención de volver a intentar cruzar la frontera con México (aún cuando cada cruce represente un mayor riesgo), en vez de ser retenidos durante su proceso por semanas o meses.

Last year, Learning Rocks achieved its best results in the organization’s 20 year history with 92% of students improving their reading instructional levels and nearly two-thirds improving by two or more instructional levels. Additionally, Learning ROCKS! was recognized as “one of the top 50 arts- and humanities-based programs in the country” by the National Arts &amp; Humanities Youth Program Award through the [US] President’s Committee on the Arts and the Humanities.

At School: GLC has cultivated excellent partnerships with the five public schools where its students are enrolled in south Arlington. Close collaboration with schools allows GLC to provide more tailored support to students, to better understand their challenges and successes, and to align afterschool strategies with the school day. GLC staff hold weekly office hours at its five public school partners to share with and solicit information from teachers in support of students’ progress and to ensure that afterschool lessons support school priorities. GLC also places AmeriCorps Members in each of its partner schools for six hours/week throughout the year, providing direct services to 500+ students/year in their classrooms. After School: GLC provides 15 hours of academic and social-emotional support to 80 low- income 3rd, 4th, and 5th grade students each week after school (Monday – Friday) at three sites: Greenbrier Baptist Church, Virginia Gardens Apartments and Buchanan Gardens Apartments. In addition to homework help, a key function of GLC's Learning ROCKS! program is to improve students’ academic and functional English literacy skills through 30 minutes of dedicated reading activities each day at each site. Our programming utilizes evidence-based methods (e.g. independent reading, Buddy Reading, choral reading, scaffolding, etc.) to support students’ reading development each day, as well as providing targeted support to students each week (e.g. Guided Reading; Literature Circles). In addition to daily reading and homework support, we implement a variety of other project-based, experiential learning opportunities to reinforce key academic content and help students to make connections within and across content. Finally, our programming also utilizes a variety of behavior management and modeling techniques that directly support the internal developmental assets for middle childhood (Search Institute 2015), fostering students’ ability to “make good choices.” During the summer, GLC implements a six-week summer camp, offering intensive, full-day programming to reinforce academic content and prevent summer learning loss. Summer themes frequently focus on Virginia Standards of Learning topics, allowing students to explore content in richer, more experiential ways than they can during the school day. IMPACT: GLC is exceptionally qualified to provide this service and builds on a 20 year history of outstanding results. Typically, more than half of students begin the year not reading on target with their respective grade levels. In the last school year (2013-14), GLC achieved its best results in the organization’s 20 year history with 92% of students improving their reading instructional levels and nearly two-thirds improving by two or more instructional levels – a considerable achievement for the high-risk students that GLC serves who are frequently cited in achievement gap data within the schools. Additionally, GLC’s work has been lauded both locally and nationally, including its Learning ROCKS!

Afterschool Learning provides intensive, out-of-school services to 80 low income students in 3rd-5th grades.","Our overall goal is to foster Aspire! Afterschool Learning&#8217;s continued growth and success in our community. Aspire! provides a wide array of services, including our Learning ROCKS! Program designed to offer upper elementary school students academic and social-emotional support with an emphasis on improving their reading instructional levels. Last year, Learning Rocks achieved its best results in the organization’s 21 year history with 92% of students improving their reading instructional levels and nearly two-thirds improving by two or more instructional levels. Additionally, Learning ROCKS! was recognized as “one of the top 50 arts- and humanities-based programs in the country” by the National Arts &amp; Humanities Youth Program Award through the [US] President’s Committee on the Arts and the Humanities. With this campaign we aim to raise funds necessary to sustain the programming provided for the 80 students currently enrolled. By easing the financial burden on current programming, Aspire! can focus on building strategy and cultivating opportunities to expand GLC’s programming and increase the number of students we can serve in the coming years.","In 2010, the Annie E. Casey Foundation reported that children not reading proficiently at the end of third grade are less likely to graduate from high school; a follow-up report in 2012 further noted that these students are four times less likely to graduate than their peers who read proficiently. Aspire! programs aim to provide our students with daily academic support and a targeted focus on improving reading and comprehension skills. Longer term goals, then, are that students will graduate from high school and have more livelihood options available to them along with improved lifetime earning potential. Our work is vitally important to the long-term success of these students and our community. Aspire! Programs are in high demand. All sites are at full capacity and maintain active waiting lists. Most of Aspire&#8217;s referrals come directly from schools whose teachers and administrators frequently refer students with the greatest challenges. There are no other daily afterschool programs in these neighborhoods providing intensive academic support. As one parent recently said, “If you get into their Learning ROCKS! Program, it is like you have won the lottery.” – Daniel Garcia, parent of 4th grade student.","BUDGET SUMMARY Total a. Personnel &amp; Fringe 389,688 b. Program Activities 15,352 c.

Close collaboration with schools allows Aspire! to provide more tailored support to students, to better understand their challenges and successes, and to align afterschool strategies with the school day. Aspire! staff hold weekly office hours at its five public school partners to share with and solicit information from teachers in support of students’ progress and to ensure that afterschool lessons support school priorities. Aspire! also places AmeriCorps Members in each of its partner schools for six hours/week throughout the year, providing direct services to 500+ students/year in their classrooms. &nbsp; After School: Aspire! provides 15 hours of academic and social-emotional support to 80 low- income 3rd, 4th, and 5th grade students each week after school (Monday – Friday) at three sites: Arlington Mill Community Center, Virginia Gardens Apartments and Buchanan Gardens Apartments. In addition to homework help, a key function of Aspire!'s Learning ROCKS! program is to improve students’ academic and functional English literacy skills through 30 minutes of dedicated reading activities each day at each site. Our programming utilizes evidence-based methods (e.g. independent reading, Buddy Reading, choral reading, scaffolding, etc.) to support students’ reading development each day, as well as providing targeted support to students each week (e.g. Guided Reading; Literature Circles). In addition to daily reading and homework support, we implement a variety of other project-based, experiential learning opportunities to reinforce key academic content and help students to make connections within and across content. Finally, our programming also utilizes a variety of behavior management and modeling techniques that directly support the internal developmental assets for middle childhood (Search Institute 2015), fostering students’ ability to “make good choices.” During the summer, Aspire! implements a six-week summer camp, offering intensive, full-day programming to reinforce academic content and prevent summer learning loss. Summer themes frequently focus on Virginia Standards of Learning topics, allowing students to explore content in richer, more experiential ways than they can during the school day. &nbsp; IMPACT: Aspire! is exceptionally qualified to provide this service and builds on a 20 year history of outstanding results. Typically, more than half of students begin the year not reading on target with their respective grade levels. In the last school year (2014-15), Aspire! achieved its best results in the organization’s 20 year history with 92% of students improving their reading instructional levels and nearly two-thirds improving by two or more instructional levels – a considerable achievement for the high-risk students that Aspire! serves who are frequently cited in achievement gap data within the schools.

Many are undocumented, or have family members who are undocumented. They have suffered from some form of persecution, and have lived in extreme poverty throughout their lives. As a result, they are among the most vulnerable members of our community – often exploited by employers or landlords, at risk of abuse, and often excluded from existing social programs. The Leadership Development and Training program seeks to build self capacity, promote education, and nurture leadership within the vulnerable refugee and immigrant community in the Bay Area. Through this program, EBSC guides immigrants and refugees to become self-sufficient and knowledgeable about their rights, ultimately helping to uplift the voice of the immigrant community. This further enables participants to be contributing members in society. Although hundreds of community members participate in the Leadership Development and Training program at different levels, roughly 10 to 12 community members are identified as community leaders, who receive additional training and who eventually give back to their communities. EBSC’s Community Development and Education (CDE) Coordinator works with various nonprofit organizations, community professionals, and EBSC staff to develop workshops educating leaders on their rights. Topics for the bimonthly workshops include human, tenant, and workers’ rights as well as finance, real estate, business opportunities, and access to social services. CDE also hosts several community forums, which leaders attend and help to organize. During these forums, which are attended by over 50 members of the immigrant and refugee community, CDE disseminates information on current immigration policies and other resources relevant to the community. Leaders also hone their public speaking skills through advocacy. For example, CDE leaders participate in the annual Immigrant Day during which they visit the State Capitol and meet with politicians, and they make presentations to churches and congregations during which they provide their personal testimonies. Immigrants and refugees contribute to our society in meaningful ways, they help to grow our economy and add to the beauty of our cultural diversity. Their rights must be protected, and their voices must be heard.","The Leadership Development and Training program strengthens the community at-large by encouraging capacity building, honing public speaking skills, and developing leadership skills in a population that otherwise would not have access. As more immigrants and refugees are trained through this program, their families, and their communities are better informed about social, economic, and immigration policies. They have access to better jobs and higher education, which can help them to escape from the cycle of poverty. Furthermore, they have the tools to advocate for more humane policies that affect their communities, and ultimately the world. The effectiveness of the Leadership Development and Training program is measured by the changes in the lives of the CDE leaders, and ultimately, in how loudly the voice of the immigrant community is heard. Previously, CDE leaders have advocated for the California TRUST Act under which undocumented immigrants can assist law enforcement without risk of deportation. Leaders have also advocated for the Oakland City ID, which is issued to all Oakland residents, regardless of immigration status, and which additionally provides some banking services for individuals who otherwise would not have access. Leaders graduating from the program have gone on to work for nonprofits, and newspapers. They have helped their neighbors to fight for their rights. In this way, they have empowered themselves and their communities.","EBSC Budget Size: $ 945,058 Community Development and Education Budget: Personnel: $43,478 Supplies: $1,140 Rent &amp; Utilities: $923 Travel: $400",,"In 1982, East Bay Sanctuary Covenant (EBSC) grew out of, and largely shaped, the Sanctuary movement which was responding to the influx of Central American refugees escaping to the United States. In 1992, EBSC developed its Affirmative Asylum Program, which is now one of the largest asylum programs in the United States. In 2006, EBSC launched its Community Development and Education program to assist clients with employment training, medical assistance, cash and food stamp assistance, higher education, leadership development, and to learn English and prepare for the U.S. citizenship examination. Currently, EBSC directly serves over 2,000 immigrants and refugees in the Bay Area. EBSC works especially closely with vulnerable groups within the Bay Area’s immigrant and refugee community, who are often the most highly traumatized, yet underserved. These vulnerable groups include indigenous Guatemalans, LGBT or HIV-positive individuals, victims of gender-based violence, and unaccompanied children. There is a clear need for EBSC’s services, now, more than ever. For more than 30 years, EBSC has been dedicated to serving the immigrant and refugee community, and continues to be the source of guidance and support for thousands of vulnerable members of this community. EBSC is one of the few organizations that accepts walk-in clients. Our services are free or low-cost, and no one is turned away for lack of ability to pay.

The children come from countries such as Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala&#8211;countries that have the highest murder rates in the world. These are children who have made a treacherous journey to the United States alone in order to escape their home conditions. Our organization believes in helping these children who are not immigrants but rather refugees. What are they fleeing from? Most of these are children are fleeing from gangs after being recruited, having been targets of attacks, and receiving threats to their lives. Different gangs, including Mara Salvatrucha 13 and 18th Street gangs that originated in Los Angeles, plague Central America. In addition to this, a lot of these children also come from difficult home situations. Their parents may be abusive, they may have been abandoned, or they live in extreme poverty. What will happen with the funds we raise? Your contribution will help our organization find these children representation in their immigration proceedings. Regardless of where one stands in the issue, these children have a right to due process, for many of them do qualify to remain in the United States legally. The American immigration court system does not provide them a public defender or any assistance in finding attorneys. The children are forced to advocate for themselves against a trained state prosecutor, which almost always results in their deportation. We believe that we need to close the gap so that these children can access the relief that American law allows them. The funds we raise through this campaign will go towards finding attorneys to help Central American children with their immigration cases. Please give to our project today and help us make a difference in these children&#8217;s lives. They have suffered enough in their home countries and in their journey here to the United States. These children have the right to due process and a healthy and safe childhood.","Our goal is to try and find lawyers for as many children as possible. We represent many children ourselves and we try to find lawyers for those we cannot represent. Unfortunately, we do not have the resources to find lawyers for all children. Children who do not have lawyers often don’t go to court and, when they do, they lose their case and are sent back to the same violent circumstances that caused them to flee in the first place. Often they are harmed, sometimes they are killed. Our organization tries to constantly educate the general public that these children are refugees and not immigrants. They come here to the United States hoping to live in safety, yet they are put in an immigration process that is both alienating and traumatizing. The existing American legislation does give these children legal options for them to remain legally in the United States. It is the structure of the courts that is problematic. Our hope is to close the gap so that there is access to said legal options.

These adventures form the foundation for teaching children Kreyol literacy, numeric operations, basic science concepts and a host of other fundamentals.

La Bodega is a &#8216;storefront&#8217;-style clinic &#8211; no appointments are necessary, patients just walk in if they are uninsured and need non-acute healthcare. This &#8216;storefront&#8217; approach to healthcare is one that is very familiar to the population served by CEHC. Most of Clinica Esperanza/Hope Clinic patients are new immigrants from Central and South America who work low-wage jobs and have limited English skills. La Bodega provides care in their own idiom, while remaining sensitive to cultural differences.. Between 2 and 7 PM, Monday through Friday, La Bodega provides walk-in service for non-acute health problems, eliminating the need for uninsured patients to use the Emergency Room as a source of routine healthcare, reducing their out of pocket costs, and improving access to health screens for chronic diseases. This is a new project at CEHC. Nearly 1200 individuals have accessed free healthcare, health screens and immunizations at La Bodega since CEHC opened the project in 2012. La Bodega saves low-income patients money. Hundreds of thousands of dollars in out of pocket costs for low-income patients are avoided. La Bodega connects Individuals who may have chronic diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, overweight, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular disease to health care and the health system. The impact of La Bodega has been remarkable. During the first 5 months of this project (in 2012-2012), La Bodega saved patients more than $120,000 (that would have been spent on ER care) and garnered more than $1.3M in preventive health value (see our article in the Journal of Community Health here: http://bit.ly/Nurse_Run_CHEER). The impact of La Bodega continues to grow. Over the past 12 months, the estimated savings was 7.1 million dollars. The cost of providing this innovative service was just over $100,000. This is a 70 to 1 return on investment for each dollar you contribute to this project. More information can be found at: http://bit.ly/CEHC_Publications orhttp://bit.ly/CEHC_NewportMercury How do we do it? La Bodega / CHEER clinic is run by a registered nurse, which cuts down on the cost of the care that is provided. Navegantes (healthcare outreach workers) are available to provide nutritional advice and medication adherence counseling in the patients. Eligible patients are also assisted with applications to Obamacare. More than 70% of the patients are from Central and South America, and the majority earn less than $15,000 per year. We have partial funding for this project. For 2014, we have obtained $15,000 in funding from United Way of Rhode Island. We are seeking to raise more to fund the Bodega/CHEER clinic for the rest of the year. With every $110 raised through this campaign we will be able to support a patient for the full year. We plan to highlight the success of this important method for improving access to healthcare for low income immigrants in press releases, publications, and healthcare journals.","Patients attending La Bodega/CHEER clinic represent a very low-income, limited English proficiency (LEP) population of (predominantly Hispanic) immigrants who are currently uninsured. This population is severely impacted by limited access to health care. In addition to poor health, adverse economic outcomes (bankruptcy) can be attributed in part to limited access to care. While some of these patients are eligible for healthcare under the Affordable Care Act (and La Bodega provides assistance with registering for care under the ACA), but many (70%) are not. In addition to obtaining non-urgent care at La Bodega, patients are provided with access to simple health screens and to routine vaccinations (influenza, DPT). Individuals who had chronic diseases (diabetes, hypertension, heart disease) are identified and integrated into the primary care clinic at CEHC as appointments become available (if uninsured), or patients are linked with care (for insured patients) at another location. Walk in patients are also invited to participate in health intervention programs based at CEHC such as linguistically- and culturally-appropriate nutritional education classes. Patients are able to stabilize their chronic diseases at CEHC, while they transition into a clinic that provides continuity of care. Thus in addition to serving an immediate health need, La Bodega serves a second, important purpose: by connecting to the clinic, low income patients are integrated into the primary health care system. La Bodega is a unique solution to the health care access problem. Uninsured walk-in access culturally sensitive linguistically appropriate care provided by nurse-managed volunteers. La Bodega lowers the barriers to health care faced by a large number of new immigrants and provides a bridge to better health.","Total Costs Grant Request 1. Personnel = $52,039.00 (See Detail) 2.

Addressing educational disparities is the key to addressing all others. In our state Hispanics make up 9% of our population yet in some colleges make up less than 1% of attendees. Lack of representation in key fields is one of the factors that lead to health, advocacy, environmental, educational, and all other disparities. Without educated Latino professionals to represent the communities from which they originate, change for the better will be slow moving and ineffective. Educating young Latinos today lays the foundation for these youths to build better futures for the entire community. This will be difficult to measure long term, but we can keep track of those who attend the workshop and measure how many sign up and stay in college the following years.","$2,000 toward training and expenses. $1,000 toward office supplies and printing. $4,000 toward stipends, and $3,000 toward outreach.",,"AMEXCAN's mission is to promote the active participation of Mexicans and Latinos in their new communities and encourage the appreciation, understanding, and prosperity of the Mexican and Latino community through cultural, educational, leadership, health, and advocacy activities.

About two years ago, CAIR Coalition met Maria. Maria’s father was abusive and would drink frequently, but abandoned her family when she was 6 years old. After he left, he provided the family with no financial support. Her father died from alcohol poisoning when she was around 11 years old. In 2011, an MS-13 gang member, one of the most violent gangs in the world, shot Maria’s brother in the chest and he was taken to the hospital, where he spent several weeks. Maria’s brother cooperated with police to give a statement and the family went to court three times to testify against the gang member in person. The gang member was imprisoned for several months. After being released, the gang member threatened to kill the family for putting him in jail and Maria was afraid to leave the house for fear of her life. Maria fled El Salvador because she knew if she stayed she might not live. When she came to the US, CAIR Coalition represented Maria and was successful in attaining a Special Immigrant Juvenile Status, based on abuse and abandonment from her father. Our representation continued and she was recently granted permanent residency. She is now thriving in the U.S., where she can have a normal, safe life and not be afraid to leave her house. Maria’s story is not uncommon. The UN refugee agency estimates that over 50% of children arriving at the US border might qualify as refugees.

Every year, our SLI students face the challenge of finding financial resources.

As this demographic shift has greatly impacted our state&#8217;s educational landscape, a lack of resources limits Latino students in their academic development. As a three year mentoring program, SLI excels in helping close the gap in the college access pipeline for Latino students. One-hundred percent of SLI graduates finish high school in contrast to the national 76% of high school graduates. Additionally, SLI maintains a 70% college-going rate versus the national rate of 35%. Although SLI has been successful in adequately preparing students that are accepted to four-year universities, some SLI students are unable to attend college or no longer remain enrolled due to financial pressures. Financial support is the most important resource remaining to close the gap preventing Latino students from accessing higher education.","We have a simple, one-time budget of $10,000 that will be directly transferred to the Triangle Community Fund that houses our scholarship donations.","The mission of Scholars’ Latino Initiative (SLI) is to promote educational equity and diversity by providing access to higher education to Latino students.

Its mission is to promote educational equity and diversity by providing Latino students the tools to access higher education. SLI accomplishes its mission by engaging high-potential Latino high school students in a structured three-year mentoring and college preparatory program that promotes academic excellence, leadership, community involvement and personal integrity. Through SLI, mentees develop an enthusiasm for higher education and are better prepared for college success. SLI's origins are rooted in the personal involvement of its two founders. Moved by a public radio story about college access for Latino students, Dr. Peter Kaufman contacted Paul Cuadros (award winning investigative journalist, author of ""A Home on the Field,"" and soccer coach at Jordan-Matthews High School in Siler City) and the two collaborated to create SLI in 2003. Cuadros later joined the faculty at the School of Journalism and Mass Communication at UNC in 2007. He is currently an associate professor at the school. In its eleven year history, SLI has transformed from a small student group mentoring a handful of students into a highly regarded and successful vehicle for student achievement which has served more than 200 high school Latino students since 2008. SLI remains primarily a student-led and student-run organization. Two student co-directors are elected annually to coordinate the activities of approximately 75 UNC sophomore, junior and senior mentors selected in their sophomore year. The SLI model focuses on four core components: 1) one-on-one mentoring; 2) community service; 3) the College Prep Seminar (CPS), a college level course designed to expose mentees to the rigor of college-level classes; and 4) SLI SMART (Skills Making Applicants Ready for Tomorrow), a college prep class. In addition to these core components, mentors lead and/or participate in the following committees: Development, Visual Communications, Parental Involvement, and Community Building (events focused on peer support and engagement). UNC mentors also serve as site coordinators for six high school sites. They work with selected teacher liaisons at each school responsible for coordinating program logistics/persistence and completion. UNC faculty and staff are extensively engaged in SLI. Our College Prep Seminar is taught by faculty. Faculty and staff, working and teaching across the academic spectrum (e.g. admissions, chemistry, education, public health, journalism), actively participate on SLI’s Board of Directors, which meets monthly. A part-time program coordinator also serves as SLI’s staff. Finally, SLI helps to secure scholarships for SLI students through an awards process managed by a committee composed of community members.

Our goal is that all of the students in our partner school would have the individualized college, academic, and social support necessary to unlock their full potential. To many of our students, “college” is an amorphous, irrelevant idea. Our goal is to make postsecondary degrees an expectation to our students and a concrete step towards a future career. As these students come from economically disadvantaged neighborhoods, they often lack the academic, social, and emotional support needed to prepare for and to succeed in postsecondary education. Through a range of programming that includes support for the transition to high school, college readiness, college access, and student leadership programs, 12+ hopes to build a school culture in which every student: 1. understands of the economic, social, and personal value of a postsecondary degree, 2. expects to continue onto higher education, 3. believes in his/her full potential and ability to succeed in their academic endeavors, 4. acts with initiative to engage with educational opportunities, 5. inspires others to strive for higher goals of academic success, and is equipped with the tools to be successful lifelong learners.","Many of our students desire to go to college, but applying, enrolling, and eventually persisting in college or a postsecondary pathway involves multiple supports that do not exist for our students. With significant budget cuts in the School District, many counseling programs are slashed or must focus on other responsibilities within the school. In Kensington, counselors are severely overworked and are unable to provide students with the personalized attention that they require. Students are often left to navigate procedures on their own. Beyond these resources, students often believe that college is not a feasible option for them, based on lack of precedent in their schools and family structures. However, in today’s economy, a postsecondary education is an essential qualification for the majority of jobs, and even more critical for students of a lower economic background who may have fewer social networks and resources to rely on. We believe that these students can succeed, with some support and guidance. We believe that we can and must change school cultures, to empower students to achieve more, and to inspire success within the student body. &nbsp;","In the Philadelphia School District, ongoing budget cuts have resulted in under-resourced schools where overworked faculties lack capacity to provide individualized attention towards students. If not eliminated altogether, understaffed counseling programs must address administrative school needs with little time left to meet student needs. Even further, there is a sharp deficit of information and opportunities available for students to develop and explore their post-secondary interests. Without adequate support systems in place, schools unintentionally undermine their students’ academic mindsets and perspectives on education resulting in countless numbers of youth failing not only to advance beyond the 12th grade, but they often fail to graduate at all. In the Philadelphia School District, only 1 in 10 students earn a postsecondary degree. According to a 2013 study by the Strategic Data Project, more than half of the jobs in the state will require postsecondary education by 2018. Given that the average college graduate earns approximately $844,000 more over a lifetime than a high school graduate, the failure for students to enter and succeed in postsecondary education carries greater economic ramifications for the region. This calls for an active agent that distills a powerful counter-narrative, works to improve the learning environment, and supports students on an individual level. &nbsp;",12+ strives to increase educational equity by building school cultures that inspire academic achievement and empower students to pursue postsecondary education. 12+ partners with schools in underserved communities to redefine what is possible for their students by providing individualized academic and postsecondary support for students. &nbsp;,"Since 2010, 12+ has permeated the halls of Kensington Health Sciences Academy, where the majority of its students are Latino, with a culture of success in postsecondary education. 12+ partners with Kensington to build a college-going culture, working to fill in gaps of service through comprehensive programming as well as to redefine what is possible for students. In order to reach all students within the school, 12+ operates a PLUS Center, a dynamic hub for college, career, and academic resources previously unavailable to the student body. Centers highlight achievements and promote a shared sense of belonging within the school. 12+ offers a wide range of programming, including college readiness, college access, college persistence, and student leadership programs. Most importantly, 12+ strives to build meaningful relationships that place the well-being of the student as the highest priority. By developing relational trust, 12+ steadily fosters a community where students are empowered to succeed academically. Through this whole-school model that includes comprehensive programming for all students within the school, 12+ has been integral in increasing the overall college enrollment rate from 11% in 2010 to over 70% in 2013.",ended,20150223.0,12plusphilly,

The adverse effects of childhood cancer on parents’ emotional and physical functioning are well documented. Studies on the psychological effects of childhood cancer on parents concluded that they experienced significantly more distress as opposed to a group of parents outside of this situation. They reported to experience poorer physical and psychosocial quality of life, and displayed a range of emotional challenges especially anxiety and stress symptoms. Further, pediatric oncology research has identified significant associations between mothers’ and fathers’ distress and their reports of their child internalizing symptoms including depression and anxiety. Parents’ distress prior to their children undergoing cancer treatment procedures were found to be positively correlated with children’s report of pain. Additionally, there are differences in parental anxiety and quality of life when additional factors are taken into account. For example, parental stress was negatively correlated with income and education, indicating that the better educated and higher the salary, less stress symptoms. Less educated parents are less engaged in activities with their children. Our 25 years of experience validate these findings, we have first-hand knowledge of how this life-threatening situation leaves mothers feeling impotent and lost. By providing these women with by psychosocial interventions, such as education in a skilled trade, they will be better prepared to provide emotional and financial stability to their families.","Goal Materiales Unit Unit Cost USD Total USD Provide 140 hours of theoretical and practices classes on sewing, beauty and jewellery (10 months period).

It has also developed specific educational materials on the disease in order to increase social awareness and disseminate information on childhood cancer´s warning signs. It’s implemented a telemedicine network with Dell Inc. in Chiapas to enhance access to quality childhood cancer care in rural areas of the country and to reduce costs and time of diagnoses. Access to Comprehensive Care provides access to the anti-cancer medications and procedures not granted by the government; including laboratory, imaging tests and radiotherapy. Through its distribution network, Casa de la Amistad ships medications and supplies to 29 hospitals in 17 states. By delivering medications to the hospitals closest to its patients, the NGO helps eliminate costly and time consuming trips to Mexico City. The Education for Medical Communities Program works alongside St. Jude´s Children´s Research Hospital to train Mexico´s oncologists on the latest childhood cancer pathologies, technologies and protocols. Its fourth core program is Treatment Completion which exists to ensure that patients and families have the social support required to complete treatment, these services include: a “home-away-from-home” that provides three daily nutritionally home-cooked meals and a boxlunch, 48 private bedrooms, an accredited in-house school so children remain on track with their studies, psychosocial support, recreational activities and spaces (such as workshops and playgrounds), transportation to and from place of origin, and to all hospital visits and special suites for children with severely suppressed immune systems.

With your support, we will provide bilingual signage to local health clinics and host a community health fair offering free medical screenings, expert advice, and affordable health care enrollment assistance. We hope to draw at least 300 low-income families to this event and increase their overall access to health providers and affordable health insurance. &nbsp; At Puentes, we believe that a person’s health and quality of life should not depend on their economic status, social position, or ethnic/racial background. Over the past several years, our organization has been working to reduce health disparities and uninsured rates among Latinos and other disadvantaged communities by conducting original health research, raising awareness of health disparities, and organizing large community health fairs serving hundreds of low-income families across the region. &nbsp; We take great pride in our work and accomplishments. Puentes, for example, recently completed the city’s first health assessment focusing on the Latino population. The survey – a community health assessment of 300 Latino residents in the Mid-City area conducted in the fall of 2013 – pointed to several alarming challenges that Latino residents face in obtaining information about health care, accessing health care services, and maintaining healthy lifestyles. As a result of these findings, Puentes began working closely with the New Orleans Health Department to improve public health outreach and language access. &nbsp; In addition to our work with local health officials to improve public outreach and health access, Puentes also organizes and hosts large community health fairs in order to connect low-income Latino families to local medical resources and services. In 2014, our health fairs served hundreds of local residents by providing them with free medical screenings, bilingual educational materials focusing on nutrition and healthy eating habits, and insurance industry experts who assisted them through the daunting process of enrolling in an affordable health care plan. Through out health fairs, Puentes strives to improve health access and overall quality of life among low-income families and communities.","Latinos face many barriers to health access and are also one of the country’s most disproportionately uninsured populations. Our project addresses these problems by working to increase health access and enrollment rates among Latinos. Several factors may account for poor health access and low enrollments among Latinos: There has not been nearly enough public outreach targeting Spanish-speakers and far too few Spanish-speaking insurance navigators that could significantly boost enrollment among Latinos. Several misconceptions inhibit Latino enrollment, which are likely a direct result of poor public outreach and lack of language access. One such misconception is the belief that health insurance is simply not affordable for those on modest or meager incomes. Immigrant families of “mixed status” (i.e., those families that include both documented and undocumented individuals) mistakenly fear their medical information will be used for immigration enforcement purposes and therefore routinely avoid seeking certain kinds of medical services and enrollment opportunities. &nbsp; Puentes has encountered similar factors inhibiting health access and enrollment in the New Orleans area. As our our community health assessment revealed, large numbers of Latino residents are not familiar with local health resources and service providers, largely due to lack of language access and effective public outreach. Moreover, as a recent report by the New Orleans Health Department confirmed, one of the biggest health challenges facing the city at large is the high rate of people without health insurance, which is a major factor responsible for growing health disparities among minority populations. This project addresses these problems by improving public outreach, language access, and connecting our community members to a diverse array of health resources and service providers.","$4,000 &#8211; facility rental for community health fair $1,000 &#8211; marketing &amp; outreach","The mission of Puentes New Orleans is focused on creating access to public resources with and for the Latino community in New Orleans, encouraging civic participation, leadership, economic development, and policies leading to the integration of Latinos.","Puentes was established in 2007 as a 501 (c) (3) nonprofit Latino community development organization.

We will do this by providing low-wage immigrant community members produce bags filled with fresh fruits and vegetables, along with nutritional guidance and health education, so that individuals and families develop the ability to integrate healthier dietary habits. In collaboration with the Alameda County Food Bank, we will support healthy eating choices by running a twice-weekly produce bag distribution that provides fresh fruit and vegetables to over 300 families. Unlike many other traditional food bag distribution centers, our structure provides community members the ability to choose from a variety of healthy, nutrient-rich and low-glycemic produce options and participate in determining which fruits and vegetables we stock at our center. We recruit and train community members to become long-term volunteers in the food program, helping with food distribution, translation, set-up, and clean-up. Furthermore, our clients receive the food bags within our community space where other wrap-around services are available such as free medical clinic, mental health services, and our one-on-one nutritional consultations.","Recently-arrived immigrants, particularly low-wage workers such as day laborers, have an immense need for health and wellness services and need access to healthy food options. We have seen many clinic patients who have felt ill, lethargic, or fainted at work because they were malnourished or were suffering from food-related chronic illnesses like diabetes and hypertension. What we have seen in our clinic is consistent with what larger research showes: low-income Latinos have a high incidence of preventable illnesses correlated with poor nutrition, including high incidence of Type 2 Diabetes and Hypertension. Furthermore, most of the Latino families we serve are undocumented or have mixed-status. Because of their immigration status, many of our clients receive little to no public benefits – despite living far below the poverty level. Our program will improve the health outcomes for community members by providing access to nutrient-rich, low-glycemic fresh fruits and vegetables while also providing opportunities for community members to gain nutritional information, build community, and have the opportunity to volunteer. More importantly, our food distribution serves as an entry point to other health care and social services, and the Wellness and Prevention Program supports a symbiotic and holistic relationship between programs—community members can come to receive healthy food, gain knowledge, see a doctor, and become part of a local community center.","July 1, 2015-June 30, 2016: Expenses&#8211; Personnel: Wellness &amp; Prevention Manager (FTE 0.125) = $4680, Food and Referral Coordinator (FTE 0.1) = $3,120, Salaries = $7,800 + Benefits 21% = $1,638 = Total Personnel at $9,438.

EBSC’s clients are from underrepresented and especially vulnerable groups, including indigenous Guatemalans, victims of gender-based violence, such as domestic violence, forced marriage, female genital mutilation, Unaccompanied Children, LGBT individuals, and torture victims. EBSC supports these individuals by helping them to secure asylum in the United States. Asylum is granted to those individuals who were persecuted in their home country, and who are afraid of being persecuted if they return, due to their race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a social group. Through the asylum application process, these individuals are allowed to work in the United States, and after they are granted asylum, they can petition for their family members, and apply for residency, placing them on the path to become U.S. citizens. Providing pro-bono or low cost immigration services to asylum seekers who cannot afford a legal representative is important, since the United States does not guarantee legal representation to asylum seekers. Without the legal assistance offered by EBSC, these indigent asylum seekers will otherwise not be able to navigate the complicated U.S. asylum process. EBSC’s social services, such as free English as a Second Language classes, assistance with enrollment in school, vocational training, and job referrals, help to facilitate the process of integration, rebuilding, and healing. Since 1982, EBSC has offered support, protection, and advocacy to individuals who have sought refuge in the United States. Our asylum program is highly successful: we have been told that our asylum program is one of the largest in our country, and we have a 97% asylum grant approval rate. We are one of the few organizations in the Bay Area that offers walk-in service. Each year, out of our office in the basement of a church, we directly serve over 2,000 individuals. Our services are needed now, more than ever, visible in the unprecedented number of people who come through our door every day. Community support helps us to continue to change the lives of vulnerable people.","The United States is home to roughly 42.4 million immigrants, including 11.3 million undocumented immigrants.[1] Latin Americans make up about 52% of the U.S. immigrant population[2] , and over 75% of the undocumented immigrant population[3]. Immigrants have helped to enrich the cultural, social, and linguistic fabric of our country. Studies also show that immigrants not only help the economy, but that immigrants can influence the wages of U.S. born workers for the better[4]. Despite their important role in our society, immigrants continue to encounter roadblocks to fulfilling lives once they are in the United States. Immigrants, especially undocumented immigrants or those in the process of obtaining status, often remain hidden in the “shadows” and refrain from accessing necessary services, such as healthcare, or assistance from law enforcement[5], leaving them exposed to poverty and exploitation. Many face xenophobia and discrimination in social and professional settings[6]. Non profits, such as EBSC, are often the only resource for this vulnerable population to overcome these roadblocks to a better life for them and their family. &nbsp; In 1982, when many were closing their doors to refugees fleeing the conflict in Central America, EBSC welcomed them with open arms. Presently, EBSC works with clients from all over the world, however, we continue to work especially closely with individuals from Mexico, and Central American countries of Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador, which have the highest homicide rates in the world. EBSC also provides its clients with other types of immigration assistance: work permit renewal, refugee travel documents, adjustment of status (e.g. from asylum seeker to resident to citizen), and family petitions. Asylum seekers are also screened for other types of relief, including DACA, which provides work permits to undocumented young adults, SIJS, immigration relief for abused, abandoned, or neglected immigrant children, and U Visa, immigration relief for undocumented immigrants who are victims of crime in the United States. &nbsp; EBSC works closely with institutions that also serve Bay Area’s poor immigrants and refugees, as well as those institutions that offer services that advance EBSC’s mission. We have existing partnerships with a number of psychosocial care providers, including the Wright Institute, Family Works, Survivors International, and the Center for Survivors of Torture, as well as about ten pro bono or low-cost private psychotherapists. For the past three years, EBSC has participated in the East Bay Naturalization Collaborative, with about seven other immigrant rights organizations in the Bay Area, to file over 800 naturalization applications. We also network with Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights and the Center for Gender and Refugee Studies at UC Hastings, to coordinate on asylum cases. &nbsp; Each year, over 100 high school and undergraduate students, law school students, pro bono attorneys, and community members volunteer their time and skills at EBSC. In an effort to serve the community at large, it is also EBSC’s goal that individuals who volunteer at our organization become more knowledgeable about immigration issues, social justice, human rights, and gain the invaluable experience of having helped a fellow human being in need.

In 1992, EBSC developed its Affirmative Asylum Program, which we have been told is one of the largest asylum programs in the United States. In 2006, EBSC launched its Community Development and Education program to assist clients with employment training, medical assistance, cash and food stamp assistance, higher education, leadership development, and to learn English and prepare for the U.S. citizenship examination. Currently, EBSC directly serves over 2,000 immigrants and refugees in the Bay Area. EBSC works especially closely with vulnerable groups within the Bay Area’s immigrant and refugee community, who are often the most highly traumatized, yet underserved. These vulnerable groups include indigenous Guatemalans, LGBT or HIV-positive individuals, victims of gender-based violence, and unaccompanied children. There is a clear need for EBSC’s services, now, more than ever. For more than 30 years, EBSC has been dedicated to serving the immigrant and refugee community, and continues to be the source of guidance and support for thousands of vulnerable members of this community. EBSC is one of the few organizations that accepts walk-in clients. Our services are free or low-cost, and no one is turned away for lack of ability to pay. In this way, EBSC continues to fulfill its mission to provide sanctuary including protection advocacy, support and empowerment to low-income and poverty stricken asylum-seekers.",ended,20151125.0,EBaySanctuary,

In this way, LSC makes a difference one child at a time and it is change that lasts a lifetime. It is also change that directly benefits the communities where our clients live. To illustrate the importance of our work, we would like to share the stories of two of our clients:* Amelia was raised in Guatemala where her father was killed when she was only a baby. Her alcoholic stepfather moved into the family’s home and began raping and beating Amelia when she was not more than a toddler. Although her mother tried to defend Amelia the abuse continued. In desperation, at age 15, Amelia found a coyote who smuggled her into the US on foot. Detained at the border, she ended up in Texas, in the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement. After 3 months, she was released to a friend of the family in San Francisco where she began attending San Francisco International High School. That is when Amelia met one of LSC&#8217;s staff attorneys. Amelia&#8217;s claim for Special Immigrant Juvenile status is still pending, but once approved, she will be able to live in the US, free from the threat of deportation. Our social worker is also helping Amelia work through the emotional effects of the trauma she has suffered. Ernesto was only one year old and living in El Salvador when his mother and abusive father abandoned him. He lived with his siblings until the age of 15 when tragedy struck again: His older sister committed suicide and his brother was murdered. With no other options, Ernesto fled to the US where he was detained by immigration authorities and then released to a cousin in Oakland, CA. This is when things started to go right for Ernesto. His LSC attorney and social worker set up a legal guardianship with Ernesto&#8217;s cousin, defended him in deportation proceedings, and then filed a claim for Special Immigrant Juvenile status. After many months, Ernesto was granted lawful permanent residency. He continues to live with his cousin&#8217;s family and last semester he earned straight A’s in school. *Names and details have been changed to preserve confidentiality. &nbsp;","ExpensesFull time attorney salary $50,000 Benefits (at 23%)$11,500 Total $61,500 Revenue Foundation grants $36,500 HIP Give Campaign$25,000 Total$61,500",LSC was founded in 1975 as one of the country’s first non-profit law firms dedicated to providing free legal representation and social work services to children and youth.

The overall goal is to engage residents of the South Kensington neighborhood in Philadelphia where Raíces is currently located in a community mural project so that they can better understand the diverse cultural population changes that have occurred in the past, as well as those that are still present today. Cesar Viveros is a respected mural arts painter in the Philadelphia area who is responsible for many beautiful local murals. South Kensington is inhabited by people of Latino, German, Irish, African-American, and Arabic backgrounds. Residents will have to opportunity to learn and engage each other in a supportive environment while mural-making at various locations in the neighborhood. Community mural making painting sessions will be held at Raíces as well as churches and schools in the neighborhood. We will be having painting sessions this spring and summer, and our goal is to have the mural completed in time for Hispanic Heritage month. The current proposed site is on a 2-story brick wall that faces the entrance to our building. The completion of the mural will reflect the community’s involvement, history, and unifying characteristics, despite having different cultural and ethnic backgrounds.","The goal of our community mural project is to help residents engage each other to discuss topics that are of local and personal concern, while expressing themselves in a safe environment, both verbally and through mural- making art. In addition to the different ethnic populations in South Kensington, the Latino population continues to grow, diversifying quickly with an influx of Puerto Rican, Mexican, and Ecuadorian immigrants. The neighborhood’s Arabic community is also growing rapidly, adding to the neighborhood’s cultural mosaic. At community mural-making sessions, residents will engage and discuss each other’s history and traditions, as well as the rich history of their neighborhood, which includes many momentous achievements and conflicts. Further, residents will be made aware of opportunities and activities for both children and adults in their community that will increase participation and create an understanding of the various movements that define South Kensington.","We are pleased to collaborate with and leverage resources from the City of Philadelphia Mural Arts Program.

Since the early 1970s, Norris Square Neighborhood Project has helped generations of neighborhood youth become community environmental stewards. Grupo Motivos, a female collective of Puerto Rican community activists, created our six gardens on vacant land to create spaces of beauty for the community and to process community trauma related to violence and the drug trade in the 1980s.

Together, they sought to create safe spaces for youth and community members in the West Kensington neighborhood, which in the 1980s was deeply impacted by a deadly drug culture. This group of extraordinary women created a bilingual community center for neighborhood youth and six unique Puerto Rican gardens, an oasis in North Philadelphia long before urban agriculture was the byword it is today. Norris Square Neighborhood Project has served generations of community members with creative skills development and environmental education through the lens of Latino culture.

We have all ready weatherproofed 50% of the extension of the house but we need to complete it. This Residence was strategically planned to allocate old people, 65 and older, its extension is in one floor and has been in service for 28 years and has been the home of 308 ladies in vulnerable situation, with an average stay of 10 years per person. This is a social problem that will increase in the near future due to the fact that in less than 25 years the adult population has doubled, and old women are generally abandoned and subdued to abuse even within their own families.

Although he had met his graduation requirements, he stopped coming to class after his stepfather, a man he admired and who played a positive role in his life, left and he became depressed. When he returned to school after a period of time, he was told that he had been unenrolled due to his unexcused absences and his age. “No one at school asked about the root cause of why a student who met all the graduation requirements missed those days,” shared Jose. Shortly after being pushed out of school, he was arrested by police for selling counterfeit CDs in order to support himself. “Instead of walking across the stage receiving my high school diploma, I was walking across the Los Angeles inmate reception center receiving a booking number.” Jose was released on probation, left with heavy fines, and returned to an unstable home environment. Jose was put on a path that so many Latino young men and other marginalized youth of color are now on in the United States. He was pushed out of school without any intervention or supportive services, and put on a path to prison. But Jose is part of a movement of young people, parents, educators and advocates who are pushing back against this school to prison pipeline. “I was fortunate to cross paths with the Youth Justice Coalition, a grassroots organization that provided me an opportunity for my voice to be heard and be a success oriented individual,” shared Jose. “Most importantly they provided me with an opportunity to receive my high school diploma at Free LA High School.” Youth Justice Coalition is a member of the Dignity in Schools Campaign, a national member-led coalition of over 100 organizations across 25 states working to end school pushout and ensure that every child has a human right to a quality education and to be treated with dignity.","Across the United States 3 million students are suspended from school each year, most often for minor misbehaviors, such as talking back or missing class. Latino and Black students, students with special needs, immigrant youth and LGBTQ students are suspended, expelled and arrested in schools at higher rates and punished more severely than their peers. Latino students are suspended and expelled at a rate 2 times greater than white students. Black and Latino students make up 70% of school-based arrests. The use of these punitive discipline practices exclude students from the classroom and increase the likelihood that they will be pushed out of school and into a pipeline to prison and low-wage work. We at the Dignity in Schools Campaign (DSC) promote more positive and common sense approaches to discipline that keep students in school while holding them accountable to the school community.

The work doesn’t end there because though students have only started thinking about their future after our presentations, we encourage them to stay connected with us and our speakers in our supportive social networks.

In these surveys, we will focus on how motivated they currently are in school, how much effort they are putting into their schooling, and how confident they are in reaching their goals. With multiple presenters visiting a school throughout the school year, students will hear from a diverse group of role models that they can connect with and learn from. This will ultimately aim at increasing their motivation towards pursing post-secondary education and academic success.

Help us eradicate anemia in rural El Salvador!,"The first 1,000 days in a child’s life represent a window of opportunities to ensure a better a future for them, anemia represents an obstacle for children to reach their full development. Anemia is the deficiency of iron in the blood and when left untreated can lead to permanently affecting a child’s brain function, impact their intellectual performance causing difficulty in learning, it lowers their energy level and affects their interactions with other people. In El Salvador 42% of children from 6 to 24 months have anemia. The objective of “Guaymango Anemia Free” is to eradicate this condition in all children under 5 years of age in the municipality of Guaymango. This is a rural municipality located in the department Ahuachapán of El Salvador and is classified as a municipality with extreme severe poverty. We have already reduced the percentage of anemia from 45% to 15% but there is still work to be done and children that need us. It is through the invaluable support of people committed to the development of children in Latin America that thousands will receive nutritional care to overcome anemia; iron supplements and education on healthy eating practices for them and their families. Initially we will carry out a screening to all children under 5 in the municipality and those who have anemia will be treated with a 3 month treatment of iron combined with education sessions on how to prepare foods with high iron content and Vitamin C to increase the absorption of the iron. This treatment is given by a doctor and the sessions are given by a nutritionist, both activities take place once a month in an accessible community venue. We want all the children in Guaymango to have more and better opportunities so that they can enjoy a fulfilled life.","We are convinced that investing in the equation of more nutrition plus better education plus higher income will equal less poverty. Proper child nutrition and development has the ability to influence the economic and social prosperity of a country. According to the official national survey, in El Salvador 50.2% of rural households live in poverty and at a national level 42% of children from 6 to 24 months have anemia. This data presents a need to invest in children so that they can reach their full potential and become productive men and women who contribute to the overall development of the country; helping children overcome the condition of anemia gives them this opportunity. Anemia is the deficiency of iron in the blood and when left untreated can lead to permanently affecting a child’s brain function, impact their intellectual performance causing difficulty in learning, it lowers their energy level and affects their interactions with other people. Guaymango is categorized as municipality with extreme severe poverty according to the National Poverty Map; by diagnosing and treating children, who otherwise would not have this opportunity we are changing thousands of lives. We measure the progress and results by doing an initial screening for anemia if the child results positive then treatment is given for three month, after we perform the test again to ensure that the child is anemia free.","Budget &#8220;Guaymango Anemia Free&#8221; Prevention Treatment Screening $6.00 $9.00 Iron suplements $- $10.00 Nutritional sessions $7.00 $7.00 cost per child $13.00 $26.00 Budget Size : 1,811,849.00",,"Fundación Salvadoreña para la Salud y el Desarrollo Humano (FUSAL) is a private non-profit organization, which channels the experience and social responsibility of Salvadoran businessmen and women committed to human development, it stands in solidarity with those less favored of society and puts itself at the service of them.

In a country like El Salvador opportunities are scarce and resources are limited, FUSAL works with the most vulnerable populations in strategies that will help them progress socially and economically to break the vicious cycle of poverty and overcome it. With our flagship program Libras de Amor we seek to eradicate poverty through the reduction of childhood undernutrition and anemia. For more than 10 years we have implemented a holistic model that focuses on personal development and targets both familial and community environments; we have benefited more 160,000 people in 21 municipalities of El Salvador. &nbsp;",ended,20151127.0,FUSALorg,

We want to be able to advocate for better public policies to respect their basic human rights and give them a voice. We will accomplish this through three main objectives: 1) Educate the general public, both immigrant and non-immigrant community members, about the structural causes behind the migration of kids from Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras to the United States. Through empathy and understanding, we hope to create dialogue and improve the lives of our immigrant community. 2) Provide immediate legal advice for undocumented migrant families in the Greater Boston area with the help of pro-bono legal professionals and partnerships between our Legal Department and local allies. We want to give a voice to the voiceless, educate them about their rights and in the process empower them. 3) Make changes in public policy at the local, state and national level to support the arrival and equal treatment of these youth. We need to meet with local officials, allies and members of the faith community to create a safe haven for immigrants and let them know that Massachusetts stands with them.

We are already seeing a large influx of families reaching out to Centro Presente this summer and with your help we will be able to obtain the proper resources to properly assist and empower them. These children are escaping dangerous levels of structural poverty, violence, gang threats and insecurity in their countries to come to the U.S. and many have ended up in Boston as they reunite with family members who are already here. With a huge deficit in legal advice and services available to these children we have the opportunity to unite these families to know their rights and stand in solidarity.","$7,500 includes funds for: Video Production Photographer Food &amp; Beverages Travel Expenses Supplies Marketing Materials Printing Services","Centro Presente was founded in 1981 by Sister Rose Marie Cummings in direct response to the rapidly growing community of Salvadoran refugees fleeing violence, government repression and instability during the civil conflicts in Central America in the 1980s. Many came to settle in the Central Square area of Cambridge, where they joined hands with the faith-based and legal services communities to create Centro Presente, to address their needs as a new immigrant community. Centro Presente was at the forefront of what was at the time a growing movement across the country struggling for rights for Central American immigrants facing discriminatory immigration policies, as well as struggling in solidarity with social movements in Central America to oppose US military intervention. Leadership development is a very important component of our mission and our work. We recognize that the members of our community bring to this country their personal experiences and capabilities and in return we provide them the space to build opportunities to develop and exercise leadership. Our leadership development model focuses on community organizing around specific themes like immigrants' rights, workers' rights and civic participation. The model engages, internally, our staff, board, members, and program volunteers, and externally, allies and other community stakeholders. For example, our Board is composed of Latino immigrant workers and youth members. Through participation in our committees, the members of Centro Presente have the opportunity to be actively engaged in leading campaigns and activities that impact their own lives, as well as the lives of their families and the broader community. We provide our members with the opportunity to not only receive workshops and to meet and share experiences with others, but also to train others in what they have learned, to organize new members and to exercise their leadership in the community. More than just action, Centro Presente provides a space for our members to reflect and collectively analyze important issues, such as our definitions of leaders and leadership, the situation of immigrant workers in the US and in Central America and other Latin American countries, the connection between the global economic system and immigration, and its impact locally.","Established in 1981, Centro Presente is a member-driven, state-wide Latin American immigrant organization dedicated to the self-determination and self-sufficiency of the Latin American immigrant community of Massachusetts. Operated and led primarily by Central American immigrants, Centro Presente struggles for immigrant rights and for economic and social justice. Through the integration of community organizing, leadership development and basic services, Centro Presente strives to give our members voice and build community power.",ended,20140820.0,,

She was born in “Comuna 13″, but spent most of her youth in the countryside, where she worked with agriculture and farm animals for a living. She began working at a young age to help support and thus was unable to finish high school. She now has a 13 year-old son, who is currently studying, and a few years ago went through a painful divorce where her husband left her without any financial support. Before she arrived to CadaVida, she was unemployed, not eligible to receive any social benefits from the government and had no professional skills, which made it difficult to find a job and earn a stable income to support her son and pay living costs. CadaVida seeks to provide alternative solutions to well-known and long-lasting challenges that continue to plague the many women throughout Colombia like Aide who remain vulnerable to effects of poverty, violence and inequality. Our initial efforts start in Comuna 13, one of the most dangerous areas of Medellin, where there is an abundance of violence and poverty. We differ from existing Colombian organizations because we believe that long-term, sustainable change comes, not from outside donations or simple assistance, but from action within a community. Our program is unique in combining practical skills training with income-generating opportunities, with the hope that this model can spread, alter the way Colombians approach community services and finds way to not only help, but prevent or reverse the core problems. We do this by working with women in the following ways: We educate women participants on the importance of getting actively involved in their own communities and how creating a stronger community can have impactful economic and social benefits for all. We build women participants self-esteem thru workshops on personal image (e.g. fashion, makeup) that helps them recognize themselves as beautiful women and develops self-confidence that will allow them to function in a work environment. This is one of the most important pillars because many of these women face various types of violence and societal stereotypes that oppress and undermines their confidence. We offer courses in entrepreneurship, sales, finance, IT/Computers and leadership over a period of 9 months. After an intensive first month, we also provide opportunities for them to apply those skills in real business situations immediately so they can further develop and also earn income immediately. They continue to receive ongoing coaching and mentoring that will guide them towards their goals. Our programs find new lives for unused goods (i.e. surplus firsthand clothes). For example, we receive firsthand surplus garments donated by clothing brands – these clothes would normally be thrown away and burned to save expense and CadaVida instead takes this opportunity to give these items a second lifetime through our program. Women use these clothes and act as mirco-entrepreneurs by selling into their own communities. This allows “waste” to become a tool to drive economic activity and improve the quality of life for women from low-income backgrounds and their families.It is noteworthy that when a woman starts the program that the initial objective is to undertake in the business of selling clothes within the first year, alongside with other women who entered at the same time. This allows them to strengthen their skills and confidence together. We also make sure that they are responsible for their finances, settle their debts and save for starting their new business or career following the program. With CadaVida, every woman advances their own path and it is indisputable that each is transformed to believe in themselves, set their own goals and become an economically active, independent woman who contributes at home and sets a strong example to her children, who in turn will follow suit. The empowerment of these women has cascading effects on their community and society. Coming back to Aide, now after being in our program for over one year, she has completely changed her and her son lives for the better. She passed all the modules of our program “Puntadas de Mujer” and with the money and skills she earned during the program she is now ready to take over her own business and will open her own beauty spa in her house! With your help we want to provide the opportunity to more women to take control of their own lives and have an opportunity to make changes for the better! Some of the amazing women we hope to serve in our next cohort starting in 2016: María, 42, widow and mother of three. Ruth, 23, single mother, 3 children. Dreams of having her own restaurant. Ángela, 32, single mother, 2 children, wants to study finances and accounting. Irma, 20, Single mother of 2 children,wants to help other women. Lorena, 38, Single mother with one son who wants to grow her handcraft business.","In Colombia, over 35% of children age 0-14 live in single-parent households, the majority headed by women from low-income backgrounds. UN studies show single mothers struggle to achieve financial stability due to gender gaps in wage and employment, and the discriminatory effects of Machismo. This problem is compounded by a lack of affordable childcare and education, and limited government capacity to deliver services. CadaVida sees a need for more education and job opportunities for these women. When a woman is empowered, she can take care of her children and make the best decisions to improve her family’s life. Financial stability allows a woman to buy quality food, offer her children better educational options, and be independent of others. Stability allows a woman to make her own decisions and realize what she is capable of. CadaVida Foundation is built on the belief that each life is important, and that stronger women lead to stronger families, and stronger communities as a whole.",,,"CadaVida Foundation was born in Medellin, Colombia, out of a desire to help single mothers become emotionally and financially independent. In Spanish, CadaVida means “Each Life.” We believe that every life is important, and we believe that empowering women helps not only themselves and their own families, but also creates stronger communities and a powerful, positive impact in the world. CadaVida Foundation’s main goal is to provide entrepreneurial training and job opportunities to women from low-income backgrounds, and to women who are solely responsible for financially supporting their families. We want to help women realize their own potential, access economic opportunities, and be able to take care of their own families. We believe that every woman has potential that can be unleashed with the right support and tools. For a woman who is currently struggling, just one opportunity can open the door to countless other options and lead toward self-development and success. CadaVida Foundation hopes to provide Colombian women with opportunities to learn, contribute, and thrive.",ended,20151127.0,cadavida,

In Mexico however, cure rates are at least 30-40% lower, reflecting advanced stages of the disease at diagnosis and higher rates of treatment abandonment. This reality is a consequence of inaccurate or under diagnoses as a result of the lack of training, information and guidance available to primary care doctors about childhood cancer.

Latinos suffer disproportionate rates of obesity, diabetes, and early childhood cavities, among other diseases and conditions. Nearly 70% of California’s Latino adults are overweight or obese and among California’s adolescents age 12-17, Latinos are most likely to be overweight or at risk for becoming overweight. In San Francisco, 75% of adult Latinos are overweight or obese and 11% are diabetic. Other risk factors indicate a greater potential for disparities in the future, with Latino 9th graders having the second highest rates of sugary drinks consumption compared to their other classmates and the highest rates of becoming overweight. These statistics point to an alarming state of health for Latino families but there is hope. Obesity is a preventable cause of death and CARECEN is committed to working with Latino families to reverse this health crisis. By bridging the latest science, Latino cultural traditions, and community voices, CARECEN has developed a new innovative and educational tool to effectively improve the health of Latino families. Cuerpos Sanos (Healthy Bodies) is a 12 workshop series targeting low-income Latino parents for the purpose of increasing awareness and strategies to promote physical activity, health and wellness from a culturally informed perspective. CARECEN’s community health workers, who receive intensive training from experts in various fields and who also come from the community, are effective and ideal in leading this effort. Our goal is to reach 25 Latino parents over six months. We expect that access and engagement in this curriculum will lead to changes in Latino families’ physical activity levels, knowledge, and community engagement. Your support will enable San Francisco Latino families to make healthy changes in their diets and physical activity levels that will build a foundation for long lasting health and wellness in the Latino community.","Studies show that Latino immigrants are healthier upon arrival to the U.S. than subsequent generations who experience declining health. Factors contributing to this phenomenon include the lack of access to affordable healthy foods and adequate housing, poverty, neighborhood violence, immigration status, and language and cultural barriers, among others. Our years of experience providing direct social services and advocacy, along with our transnational work to address the needs of the Latino immigrant community has yielded successful results in creating positive change in our communities. We know that access to information, education, leadership opportunities, and community engagement leads to greater awareness, motivation, and capacity to make healthy changes that will impact Latino families and the larger community. Cuerpos Sanos gives families the necessary tools to lead healthy and active lifestyles that will cause a ripple effect into their communities via their nuclear and extended families. Our success is measured by participant’s engagement and satisfaction with the curriculum. Pre and post-tests will also measure the curriculum’s effectiveness in shaping participant’s understanding of the importance of physical activity in the overall health and wellness of their families and their communities.",BUDGET ITEM &amp; AMOUNTS Program Coordination $1400 Promotora Stipends $2000 Curriculum Materials $700 Healthy Snacks &amp; Refreshments $300 Participant Incentives $600 Total $5000 CARECEN&#8217;s organizational budget is $,,"CARECEN empowers and responds to the needs, rights, and aspirations of Latino, immigrant, and under-resourced families in the San Francisco Bay Area, building community leadership to pursue equity and justice.

Nutrition is vital to health, as our bodies can only function properly when provided with adequate vitamins and minerals. When you&#8217;re living on just a few dollars a day, getting proper nutrition can be extremely difficult. In rural areas of El Salvador, access to good nutrition is very limited. According to the World Food Programme, almost 20% of children under the age of 5 in El Salvador are chronically under-nourished. The women and families in the communities we accompany are calling for better access to healthy, nutrient-rich foods. Through this project, we aim to transcend the top-down charity approach that tends to predominate hunger-alleviation work. By teaching rural women to produce their own food, they will be able to secure proper nutrition for themselves and their families for a lifetime. Furthermore, the money they save goes toward a community savings and loans fund that acts as a source of capital for initiatives like small businesses so that members may lift themselves out of poverty.","This goal is both vital and urgent. According to data from the National Board of Food and Nutritional Security, 900,000 people in El Salvador are undernourished. In El Salvador, as is the case in many parts of the world, food is not considered a human right. The people of El Salvador have been struggling for years to guarantee food as a universal human right. Even the international community has joined in on the cause. According to the World Food Programme, nearly 20% of children under the age of 5 are malnourished, with a greater concentration in rural areas. Children in rural parts of the country are twice as likely to be underweight and below average height when compared to children in urban areas. These children and families cannot wait. They need your help now.","200 seed packets for gardens ($10 each) = $2,000; 100 participants in seed and plant exchange ($10 each food and transportation)= $1,000; Garden monitoring and nutritional training for three associations ($132 each)= $396; Project monitoring and support= $849; Total Cost= $4245","SHARE strengthens solidarity with and among the Salvadoran people in El Salvador and the United States in the struggle for economic sustainability, justice, and human and civil rights.","SHARE’s Model of Mutual Accompaniment: As an organization of international solidarity, SHARE recognizes that it is not our role to enter into communities, identify problems, and define and finance solutions. Instead, it is the people and communities living the cycles of injustice and oppression that need to lead the long-term efforts for structural change. Our role is to support the empowerment of and walk in solidarity with these communities, organizations, and individuals. This is called mutual accompaniment.

(*Queer acknowledges and represents the mosaic of sexual and gender identities within our communities.) The first goal is to offer an individual “outlet” to empower queer Latino youth to express their thoughts and feelings about sexuality. Through individual coaching, queer Latino youth can delve more deeply into conversations about sexuality-related issues such as coming out, dealing with family, bullying, dating, etc. Outlet coaching sessions will help queer Latino youth identify challenges faced in being a queer Latino and identify personal strengths or positive aspects of their life. The second goal is to provide a group “outlet” for queer Latino youth to unite and combat feelings of isolation, shame, and loneliness. These group “outlets” take place at GALAEI and other youth-serving agencies frequented by this demographic. (For example, GALAEI has worked closely with El Centro de Estudiantes, a school in Norris Square that offers project-based learning to primarily Latino students between the ages of 14-21 who either dropped out, or were pushed out of school and for whom El Centro is their “last stop.” Youth and faculty have requested that an Outlet group be created by and for queer Latino youth.) Through Outlet groups, queer Latino youth will build a sense of community and belonging. The third goal is to create a community “outlet” for queer Latino youth to display their pride through the production of an individual or collective piece of art. The youth will determine the method for displaying their art to the community (e.g. art gallery, community forum, etc.) The creative art project will unite and empower youth by helping them reflect self-expression, creativity, and pride about being a queer Latino.","The intended impact of the Outlet program is to enhance GALAEI’s capacity to unite andempower queer Latino youth. This goal is important because this is the only program of its kind in all of Philadelphia designed to support queer Latino youth. The Outlet program has been a successful addition to previously-existing GALAEI youth programs that serve to empower youth to be strong, proud, and confident about their sexuality and sexual health, and help youth see their potential to make a difference in their lives and in their community. Outlet reaches primarily low-income, disenfranchised queer Latino youth who reside in underserved neighborhoods, particularly in North Philadelphia. North Philadelphia is comprised of a large Latino, primarily Puerto Rican, population with exceptional social service programs for Latinos. However, the Latino-serving agencies in North Philadelphia lack queer-specific programs for youth. Programs for queer youth are primarily located in Center City but the queer Latino youth we reach are underserved, marginalized, and isolated from these queer youth services. These youth often lack a sense of community and support, which can lead them to engage in risky behaviors to numb the pain of rejection and bigotry. The Outlet program is already proving to have an impact for queer Latino youth in Philadelphia. For example, one Outlet youth says that she has to hide who she really is when she is in her &#8220;hood&#8221; but she has a safe space, a happy space at GALAEI. Another youth feels moreconfident now that she has participated with Outlet and she feels like part of the family.","Youth coordinator salary: $1,000 (3% effort of $32K salary) Fringe/benefits: $320 (at 32%) Program supplies: $780 (paper, markers, pens) Printing $1,100 (Tshirts &#8211; $5/each for approx 200 youth; Outlet postcards &#8211; $0.05/each for 2,000 ) Travel: $800 (tokens for youth to attend group/individual outlets) Program activities: $600 (food for groups, $20/group at approx. 30 groups total) 8% admin fee for fiscal oversight: $400","GALAEI is a queer Latin@ social justice organization.

GALAEI has been and remains a leading voice in queer healthcare issues, and has a 25-year history of service provision, strong working relationships, and excellent reputation in the Queer, HIV/AIDS, and Latino communities. GALAEI is the onlyHIV/AIDS education program in the state of Pennsylvania whose primary mandate is to address the needs of Latino sexual minorities. It was the lack of such programming and support that led to the founding of the organization in 1989. GALAEI has a proven track record of addressing the sexual health concerns, as well as stigma, poverty, homelessness, and lack of social support, for queer and heterosexually-identified young people through our youth programs, other HIV prevention services, and by organizing the longest consecutively-running Prom for queer and allied youth (this year marks the 19th Annual Alternative Prom). Additionally, our agency is successful due to the strong relationships and collaborations we maintain with other youth-serving agencies such as the The Attic Youth Center, Colours, The Dorothy Mann Center at St. Christopher Hospital, Youth Health Empowerment Project (YHEP), El Centro de Estudiantes, Taller Puertorriqueño, and Norris Square Civic Association. In addition to working with youth, GALAEI also provides bilingual HIV/STI testing and linkage to care, peer-led services for trans* individuals (support groups for HIV-positive trans* individuals, sexual health counseling, referrals and support with transitioning), sex-positive educational workshops and community events, and the City's first POSITIVO campaign to highlight stories of Latinos as affirming and supporting of gay and HIV-positive individuals.",ended,20140411.0,galaeiphilly,

New immigrant families have many challenges navigating their new environment and their work demands sometimes leave their children vulnerable to a variety of unforeseen societal risks. As the families seek to assimilate they may face problems related to poverty, unemployment, and anxiety over deportation. The exposure to these life stresses sometimes triggers the youth to fall prey to gang recruitment, drug abuse, and human trafficking.

These programs can be game changers for the entire family, as the parents via the children and vice verse become leaders and agents of change in their communities. There are countless examples and testimonies that prove when parents are aware of the resources and opportunities available for their children, they will take the necessary steps to make use of them, even at the cost of great sacrifice.

FLOC is the lead organization for migrant farm workers in the South and Midwest. FLOC and its founder/president, Baldemar Velasquez have been recognized by dozens of prestigious religious, civic, and humanitarian institutions for work in Northwest Ohio and in North Carolina. FLOC’s victory with Mt. Olive Pickle Company in North Carolina and the historic agreement that it is administrating with the North Carolina Growers’ Association on behalf of some ten thousand H2A guest workers is recognized as a model of immigrant worker labor rights. FLOC’s work is important because agricultural workers, migrant or domestic, are not covered under the National Labor Relations Board and therefore markedly vulnerable to abuse and exploitation. Our history is punctuated by struggle, setbacks, and eventually sweet, precedent-setting victories. Those victories, inscribed in legally binding contracts include: Eliminating the ""independent contractor"" system, America’s last vestige of Civil War-era sharecropping. Growers now pay into unemployment, workers’ compensation, and social security funds—benefits never before realized by migrant workers Raising wages for farmworkers in the Midwest pickle industry by 100% between 1986 and 1996 Rebuilding or rehabilitating a significant portion of migrant housing on union farms in Ohio Protecting our members against pesticide poisoning beyond EPA minimum standards Creating the first workable mechanism Midwest farmworkers have ever had to enforce pay, safety, working, and housing regulations—a union contract—overseen by the ""Dunlop Commission,"" an independent, private labor board chaired by former Labor Secretary, John Dunlop. But perhaps the greatest victory migrant farm workers have won is their own organization—an organization with the power to represent their interests. No longer will they remain invisible and powerless, their lives measured by corporate balance sheets. Through FLOC, Midwest farmworker families have not only won better pay and housing; they have won a greater measure of dignity and hope. FLOC has successfully pioneered supply chain organizing to benefit thousands of migrant farm workers and protect their rightsTomato pickers in Northwest Ohio organized against unfair wages and bad housing. With FLOC they won a decade long fight with the Campbell Soup Company. Today, twenty-five years later they are still reaping the economic benefits of that struggle. The next organizing victory with the Mt. Olive Pickle Company has provided better wages for thousands of migrant workers over the past seven years and opened the door to win economic gains and human rights advances for tens of thousands more in five southern states. The current farm worker campaign is on behalf of tobacco harvesters in North Carolina and Kentucky, who also pick twenty-five other crops. They number over twenty-thousand workers in the supply chain for Reynolds American and other tobacco processors. FLOC principally serves two farm worker populations in North Carolina: the over 10,000 H2A guest workers from Mexico who are contracted by the North Carolina Growers' Association (NCGA) and the estimated eighty thousand undocumented migrant workers who work for both NCGA members and non-member farmers. Correspondingly, we do community organizing among the Latino immigrant worker population that has settled out of agriculture, with emphasis on Wayne and Wilson counties. FLOC also manages Workers' Centers in Toledo, Ohio, Dudley and North Carolina serving the immigrant worker population in those cities and surrounding areas.

While Peruvian women often face issues such as lack of education and poverty, they have the determination to overcome these challenges, provided they are given the opportunity that empowers them to become self reliant. Peruvian women do not have access to basic education or technology to become successful entrepreneurs. Armed with the right tools, experience and technology; Centro provides Peruvian women the means to overcome these challenges. Through entrepreneurship education and leadership training these women would become successful, self-sustaining entrepreneurs while building thriving communities. In June 2014, Centro conducted a successful pilot training program in Peru, training 53 women in basic entrepreneurship education, financial literacy and leadership. According to Centro’s preliminary results from the pilot, we will enable the women participants to increase their household income, improve savings rates, increase self-esteem and create or retain self-sustaining jobs. Attributing to the success and high demand for its training program, in 2016 Centro will expand its outreach to 100 more women, through a combination of mobile technology and in-person workshops that will create lasting impact on communities, creating jobs and opportunities. Your donation will help us to expand our program in Peru as we continue to work with Peruvian women. With your donation, we will train women in entrepreneurship and create communities that are financially sustainable. Help us and donate to our cause that will transform lives in Peru.","Micro and medium-sized enterprises make up 98% of businesses in Peru. Of these, 40% are owned and run by women entrepreneurs. According to the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), Peruvian women are more entrepreneurial than their peers in South America. However, 85% of the women in Peru do not complete their basic education. In order to bridge the gap between lack of education and desire to be a successful entrepreneur, Centro Community Partners (Centro) provides entrepreneur and leadership training through mobile technology that helps women to execute their business ideas and create jobs and opportunities in their community. Entrepreneurship is the key to overcome poverty and transform communities. Through its innovative business planing tools and user friendly curriculum, Centro provides these women a formal training program to develop their entrepreneurial and leadership skills, build better businesses and transform communities.",None,,"Founded in 2010, Centro Community Partners is an Oakland-based nonprofit that provides entrepreneurship education, enterprise development services and access to capital to underserved low-income individuals with a focus on women.

It is a peer-based health educator program for youth from ages 13 to 18 in San Francisco. Our slogan is Felices sin Riesgo, or happy and risk free. Our youth program is based on the Diffusion of Innovations Theory (DIT) that argues learning information from your own social network and peers is the most effective. The focus of this youth development program is to inspire youth to become agents of social change, teach them the skills they need to be positive leaders among their peers, become proactive about their own health and improve their community’s wellbeing. Youth participants learn and teach about important health education topics including anatomy, healthy relationships, HIV prevention, sexually transmitted infections (STI) prevention, and family planning. Latinos En Extasis offers free sex education workshops and workshop series to other youth in San Francisco, primarily at local afterschool programs. Our Latinos En Extasis program is ever evolving and our teens who participate have various ideas on how they can educate their community about teen sexual health and wellbeing. Our project this year is focused on raising enough funds to purchase a community van that will allow our youth to further their community reach and provide our youth with outdoor education trips that take them away from the busy Mission District, bringing focus to their overall wellbeing. Reliable transportation will enable our Latinos En Extasis participants to travel together and visit more SF afterschool programs as well as attend Bay Area community events such as Reproductive Freedom Day in Sacramento or the National Young Leaders State Conference in San Jose. The access to transportation will greatly benefit our youth participants, particularly because we will be able to do college tours and provide safe rides home. Because of lack of transportation, our Latinos En Extasis program has limited ability to incorporate a holistic and youth friendly approach to community safety, wellbeing and empowerment. This project will help us incorporate more field trips, community events and other trips that empower our youth participants and allow them to reflect on the powerful work they do for San Francisco’s youth. In addition, the van will be used for other community programs in our health center, administrative health center needs(i.e. delivering medical supplies within our 4 clinics) and as needed for patients who we identify as needing transportation assistance to get to their appointments.","San Francisco, and more specifically, the Mission District, is going through a rapid gentrification process and our Latino en Extasis participants are finding themselves living further from their schools and the clinic. Our goal to provide our Latinos en Extasis youth reliable transportation to increase their efforts to educate their peers, will help us continue to build strong connections between youth and the community in San Francisco.",The amount raised will all go towards the community van.,"Mission Neighborhood Health Center honors our Latino roots with a tradition of providing compassionate, patient-centered care.

The health center offers medical services throughout the lifecycle including Pediatrics, Women’s, and Adult medicine, at four clinical sites. In addition to medical services, MNHC has innovative medical and community programs such as Clínica Esperanza, an integrated HIV care and prevention program created in 1989 for people living with HIV/AIDS, the teen clinic, which was created in 1990 in response to rising pregnancy rates among Latino youth, and the Mission Neighborhood Resource Center created to serve homeless individuals in the community. At MNHC we open our doors to the uninsured or underinsured community and provide essential primary care services throughout the patient lifecycle. In 2014, MNHC served over 12,000 patients from 25 San Francisco zip codes, of which 99% live under 200% of the federal poverty line, 83% identify as Latina/o Latino and are mostly Spanish-speaking, 8% Caucasian, 4% African-American and 2% Asian-Pacific Islander. Latino patients represent a mix of recent and established immigrants, and US born.

But Americans who are not Citizens cannot participate in this important part of American life, and do not get the right and responsibility of deciding important issues that affect their communities. So this month, help increase the political strength of the Latino community and help Latino men get the right to vote in time for the momentous election! Meet Juan, who is from Mexico and has been living in the United States for more than two decades. Until recently, he has not had Citizenship and has not been able to participate fully in American life and society, and was not able to vote in 2012 or 2014. But a few months ago, all of that changed. Juan heard about us on TV and decided to see if we could help. After determining that he was eligible, we helped him start his application for Citizenship and prepare for the Citizenship test. One of our staff members accredited by the U.S. Board of Immigrations Appeals (BIA) of the Department of Justice assisted Juan through the whole process, and on March 31, 2015, Juan received his Certificate of Citizenship at a Ceremony in La Paz, the headquarters of the Farm Worker Movement. What’s more, on that same day, we helped Juan register to vote! By obtaining Citizenship, Juan will now be able to vote in 2016, participate more fully in his community through all of the rights and responsibilities endowed with Citizenship, and increase the political and societal strength of the Latino community. Statistically, it is even more important to help Latino men become Citizens and voters because, according to Pew Research Center, Hispanic men are less likely to be voters and participate in the political process. Engaging our men will help increase the voices and power of the Latino community, as well as bring significant benefits and rights to them as new Citizens. Yet because the UFW Foundation strives to make immigration legal services affordable for all in our community, the full costs of providing such services are not met by the organization’s revenues and must be covered through the strong dedication of our donors and supporters. Without your support of the Empowering Latino Men through Citizenship project, many others like Juan will not be able to afford applying for Citizenship. But, by reaching the campaign’s goal, we will be able to inform and prescreen 125 Latino men in agricultural regions of California and Phoenix, Arizona, for Citizenship and will provide 25 with the assistance they need to apply to become Citizens this October. Once they receive Citizenship, we will also assist each one in registering to vote in time for 2016! With a little more than a year to the elections and only months to the primaries, NOW is the time for our community to obtain Citizenship and the right to vote!","“We don’t need perfect political systems; we need perfect participation.” –Cesar Chavez, co-founder of the United Farm Workers union. Participating in the political process and elections is the bedrock of America’s democracy and one of the fundamental benefits being a Citizen. Yet many in America- and in our community- cannot participate in this important part of American life because they do not have Citizenship. This particularly affects Hispanic men, who already participate in the political process and voting at lower rates than Hispanic women and all other Americans. Without Citizenship and the right to vote, Latino men are not able to have a say in how important issues that affect our communities are decided, and do not get the benefits and other rights afforded to Citizens. Moreover, they do not get to vote in the upcoming 2016 election that is now a little more than a year away. But we can change that. By engaging our men and helping them be granted Citizenship, we can help increase the voices and power of the Latino community, and bring significant benefits and rights to Latino men as new Citizens.","Revenue: Adelante!

It is an opportunity for indigenous men, women, and young people to continue education processes that contribute to the development of skills that support the construction of what the Mayan languages, Tzotzil and Tzeltal Maya call Lekil Kuxlejal, that is, the good life. Likewise, this project seeks to incorporate more dreamers of the Tzotzil and Tzeltal communities with the aim of expanding the number of trainees. Who are the dreamers for education? They are young people between the ages of 15 and 25 years old, women and men originating in Tzotzil and Tzeltal communities in the highlands of Chiapas, who have migrated or continue to migrate to support the livelihood of their families and have the dream of studying to build a better present and a better future. They are all involved in the creation and development of economic and cultural alternatives for young migrants in their communities of origin. Some arrived as children to the United States, have returned to their communities, and want to overcome barriers to obtain access to higher education. What does Dreamers for Education seek to do? Dreamers for Education is an educational project that began in December 2013 with the purpose of supporting the dreams and educational efforts of young migrants through a Scholarship Fund. In its first year of operation, it facilitated the engagement of 15 young people in different educational projects: Bartolome de Las Casas High School, located in Guaquitepec, municipality of Chilón. It is an alternative high school model. It is an alternative projectit where students apply the knowledge gained in their own community. It encourages student to develop, organize, systematize, and implement projects independently in their home environment. After three years they receive their high school diploma. Community Learning to Construct Processes for a Dignified Life, also known as Project COA, is an alternative to high school level that functions with roaming offices in the state of Chiapas. In the Project COA students participate in organizational processes with rural indigenous communities and non-profit organizations interested in specialized training to enrich the practice of students as technicians and community organizers. It works through weekly meetings and a four month professional internship in social and civil organizations. After three years students can earn their degree in Higher Technical University (TSU) or a diploma in local sustainable development. Others: There are universities that have majors that are of interest to Dreamers for Education, which are located in various regions in the state of Chiapas.","Education is one of the many rights denied to indigenous communities. The possibilities to access formal education for high school and college preparation are limited; either because there are no options in their home communities or because they do not have the resources to move or afford the minimum costs required to attend school. Discrimination also remains a reality for the indigenous population, along with educational models that do not recognize or strengthen their culture, knowledge, needs, experiences and ways of seeing life. Studying is not only learning knowledge, not only receiving information, sitting and listening, having an assignement to test what you know; to study is to open the heart and mind, it is an an encounter, to give value to who we are. It is recognizing and sharing experiences, to strive for a good life, in which life is given dignity, there is hope and dreams are built. Because of this, we won’t stop being dreamers. Patricia, a Tzotzil woman from the community of Poconichim in the municipality of Chenalho, is the coordinator of a productive group of women in their community.

Compañeros serves a significant population of Latinos and immigrants in Southwest Colorado and many are eligible for the license but the nearest motor vehicle office is four and a half hours by car and over three major mountain passes.

Our leadership wants to provide these services throughout the coming year so we can ensure that Latino and immigrant members of our community are complying with state law and more importantly, driving safely with valid licenses on Colorado roads. For those who do not solicit a license there is the option of obtaining a permit or a state id which would greatly benefit many of our community members. Another important reason we chose this goal is to create dialogue and awareness about the facts surrounding this Act as many people falsely believe this license will give undocumented immigrants all the same benefits that U.S. citizens have, such as the right to vote, the right to public benefits, etc. This is fundamentally not true, in fact the licenses will be marked stating this, yet Compañeros has realized that part of our goal and effort is to educate the general public, especially non-immigrants about this Act and how it benefits the entire community.

Increased academic skills make SLI students successful in the classroom and competitive in the college application process. Each year six to eight academic events are organized for the SLI students through two required programs: SLI SMART (Skills Making Applicants Ready for Tomorrow) and the CPS (College Preparation Seminar), a college-level class taught by UNC-Chapel Hill Faculty. SLI SMART: Mentees complete an intensive writing course (Composition 101), engage in SAT practice, mock interviews, and approach the college application process. The College Prep Seminar (CPS): The CPS, a college level course taught by UNC-faculty member Brian Hogan, provides mentees with an understanding of the structure and rigor of a college class. They are called upon to use their reasoning, critical thinking, comprehension and presentation skills in a small classroom setting with opportunity for student-teacher interaction as well as interaction with their mentors. Upon completion, mentees receive a letter of recommendation from faculty and the opportunity to compete for scholarship funds. With your support, we will be able to enhance programming in both SLI SMART and the College Prep Seminar to make our students even more competitive college applicants!","Latino students in North Carolina are distinctly disadvantaged in navigating the path to higher education. Many are first generation immigrants whose families lack the experience, language skills, knowledge and financial resources to fully engage in processes involved in college application and matriculation. In addition to language differences, cultural barriers also come to play as many Latino youth work after school to help support their families or care for younger siblings, missing out on opportunities to join clubs, volunteer and participate in their community. As the only intensive, sustained (three-year) mentoring and college prep program for Latino/a students in North Carolina, SLI has the opportunity to minimize challenges for this group of promising students in terms of raising grades, SAT scores, leadership capacity, graduation rates, scholarship support, and acceptance to four-year schools. Additionally, the personal connection formed between mentees and mentors produces powerful outcomes that make the SLI program incredibly effective and unique. Mentees find a personal advocate in their mentor to address the widespread and varied challenges that face Latino/a students in North Carolina. This relationship allows SLI to be nimble and targeted. In response to the needs of individual mentees, mentors have started health programs and reading groups, developed legal and educational guides, and created other programs to serve the unique needs of their mentees and their associated high school. Your donations will allow us to attach needed supplies to further enrich the mentoring experience for our high school mentees.","Faculty stipend: $2,000 Teaching Assistant stipend: $750 ACT/SAT Prep: $1,750 Permanent library: $500","SLI's mission is to promote educational equity and diversity by providing Latino students the tools to access higher education.

June 15 2012, marked a victory for many immigrant advocates with the executive order signed by President Barack Obama, granting qualifying youth with Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA). This change in immigration policy has allowed thousands of youth to obtain a work permit once they apply for DACA, which has changed the lives of beneficiaries because many of them have stopped living in fear and are able to become more integrated into society as contributing members. Additionally, DACA recipients also have the opportunity to obtain their social security number, identification card and/or drivers license. COFEM will continue to work hard to inform and to assist qualifying youth to apply for DACA especially since the renewal process will begin for thousands of youth in June 2014. The organization has conducted and will conduct a series of FREE DACA clinics particularly in South East L.A. During these clinics, applicants have the opportunity to meet with trained volunteers to go through the application and evidential materials to support their case. COFEM also provides the opportunity for applicants to meet with attorneys on a one-on-one basis to answer specific case by case questions and to review the application and supporting documents. COFEM has been able to count with the support of its base of scholarship recipients, volunteers from the East Los Angeles Community College and California State University, Fullerton, Sueños Club from Marco Antonio Firebaugh High School, and other groups/entities from the community. While COFEM hopes to continue providing these services to DACA recipients for FREE, the organization would also like to provide free breakfast and lunch to its volunteers for their hard work.","COFEM&#8217;s goal of providing FREE DACA clinics is important because the organization focuses on serving underprivileged areas in this effort. Many of the people that live in these areas do not have the resources to submit their DACA application on their own. Through its work COFEM tries to bridge the gap and assist the Latino youth so that they can become contributing members of society. COFEM&#8217;s goal through this campaign is to provide 3 FREE DACA clinics where more than 200 applications will be completed throughout the three events. The quality of life for the 200 plus applicants that will benefit from COFEM&#8217;s FREE DACA Clinics will change tremendously because students will have a higher self-esteem, better outlook on life and overall will feel happier. By going through the DACA process beneficiaries will feel that they are able to do more things in their communities that they were not able to do so in the past. It is important that the beneficiaries receive DACA so that they are able to contribute to society, do not have to live the in the shadows, are able to drive without the fear of persecution and have some sense of independence. Furthermore, DACA beneficiaries are able to help provide for their families by legally working in the U.S. and have a sense of belonging because thousands of them are able to work in their field of study.

In January of 2014, MEDA formally launched its Mission Techies program, which empowers low-income young adults of color to secure long-term, living-wage employment opportunities in the tech sector. As a result, participants are now establishing thriving careers in tech. Take the case of Mission Techie Edwin Gonzales, who immigrated on his own to San Francisco from El Salvador as an 18-year-old seeking a better life. Edwin longed to turn his passion for all things computer into a career in tech, but he struggled to speak English and didn’t know where to turn for guidance. As many immigrants are compelled to do, Edwin worked at a restaurant, with a tech career seemingly unattainable …, until one of his friends told him about MEDA. Edwin immediately enrolled in the Mission Techies program, seeing his pathway to success. During the free 12-week program at MEDA, Edwin learned many new skills related to hardware, software and networking, plus he enrolled in English as a Second Language (ESL) classes. After successfully completing the program, Edwin landed an internship at Mission tech company Jones IT, where he showcased his talent and was eventually offered a full-time job as a certified support technician. Edwin is now thriving and has that better life of which before he could only dream. MEDA’s goal is to sustain the success of the program and help the other Edwins that come through our doors each week. Your donation will help more dreams come true. Your dollars will pay for Mission Techies participants’ exams, such as CompTIA+ and Microsoft Office Specialist (MOS) certifications. Obtaining these essential certifications will allow Mission Techies, like Edwin, be in a stronger position to market their abilities to potential employers. Your donations, no matter how large or small, can make the difference in helping us reach our goal of $10,000. Even small contributions, when pooled with gifts from others, can help mitigate some of the obstacles that hinder our participants’ path towards a career in the tech sector.","While the tech industry has boomed in San Francisco, low-income Latino families still face numerous barriers to economic success and stability. In 2011, San Francisco’s Latino families experienced an unemployment rate that was more than double the rate of Whites and Asians. Moreover, 37 percent of Latino adults employed in San Francisco in 2010 worked in the low-wage service industry (average wages of $10-$15 per hour), which could not sustain the cost of living for a family living in increasingly expensive San Francisco. With the booming technology industry, job growth has been concentrated among professional and technical jobs offering high wages. As a result, Latinos are disproportionately represented in the tech sector. According to a 2011 U.S. Census Report, only seven percent of all U.S. tech workers are Latino. With our mission as our unifying goal, we believe that tech leaders should be represented by our community’s diversity. The Mission Techies program was instituted to establish a pathway for low-income youth and young people of color from the Mission District to access these opportunities and help close the “skills gap.” Seventy percent of our participants identify as Latino, while 85 percent have a household income of less than $50,000 and 61 percent have a household income of less than $30,000. The program provides a unique blend of information technology (IT) support training, comprehensive job coaching, and job and internship placements with companies such as Facebook, Pandora and Comcast. In addition, the program delivers its services in Spanish and English, utilizing an evidence-based curriculum customized for young adults, with graduates achieving a $500 stipend. Most importantly, the program provides its participants with access to real opportunities for living-wage employment. Finally, the curriculum is comprised of eight core competencies, which was developed principally by MEDA’s Technology Training Coordinator, Leo Sosa, who leads the Mission Techies: 1. Hardware 2. Software 3. Tech Support 4. Networking 5. Coding 6. College Prep 7. Job Readiness Training 8.

The Galería MUY is the first gallery in Chiapas (and one of the few in Mexico) to define its mission around the promotion of Amerindian artists and their art as the exploration of First Peoples’ native and multicultural identities. The art featured in the gallery includes painting and photography, video, sculptural ceramics, installation, performance, sound art and poetry. The Galería MUY opened its doors in San Cristóbal de Las Casas, Chiapas, Mexico, in December 2014. We offer new exhibitions every two months, each with curatorial texts. In addition to the gallery space in our building in San Cristóbal, we have studio space for artists’ residencies. The MUY promotes creators showing in Mayan communities (like Chamula, Tenejapa, Zinacantán). The MUY also promotes contemporary Mayan art nationally and internationally. “Muy” is the root-word for “enjoyment” in Tsotsil. At the MUY we organize performances, talks, festivities and other events to explore the rich cultural aesthetic of the Maya and Zoque, necessary for understanding the symbolism and social references prevalent in the Mayan artistic practice.

With the present project, we expect to participate in and enrich changing cultural practices. Today, it is true, there is less attention given to traditional fiestas and specifically Mayan daily practice; more to an impoverished television culture. But there is also increasing innovation in musical expression, for example: experimental music combining traditional forms with contemporary rock and “neo-classical” forms. Why not in the visual and performance arts? As a project success indicator for the year 2016, we expect at least 250 visitors from tsotsil- y tseltal-speaking communities to six exhibitions of contemporary Indigenous art. Through the present project of the Galería MUY, we expect to increase recognition of innovative contemporary art by Mayan and Zoque artists. It is much observed that the art market has become international, and the “boom” of appreciation of art extends to new interest in “outlier” communities, such as the Amerindian peoples.

Specifically, FLAP will deliver a series of free Community Legal Education workshops throughout a twelve-month period. The audience will be immigrants and migrant and seasonal workers who are unfamiliar with the American legal system and do not know or understand their rights under the law. The workshops, presented in Spanish or English with Spanish translation, and coordinated by FLAP’s staff (community outreach professionals), will inform workers and their families about their legal rights as well as free legal resources available to them. Sessions will give workers with potential grievances the confidence to come forward to FLAP with their complaints. Workshops will be located in confidential locations throughout Northern Illinois, such as in consulates, churches, schools, libraries, non-profit organizations and private homes. Sixty percent of the education workshops will take place on weekends, because that is when workers have more free time, while 40 percent will be held on weekdays after 6:00 p.m. Depending on the topic, sessions will run from 15 minutes to one, two, or four hours, and serve from two to 400 attendees at one time. In addition to education on workers’ rights, Community Legal Education workshops will feature experts presenting on areas of special interest to participants, such as health/medical services for farmworkers, taxes, immigration, personal injury, housing conditions, discrimination, sexual abuse, workers compensation, medical malpractice, and domestic violence, among other topics. Only FLAP staff, its interns and externs, and trusted volunteers and community partners will deliver the workshops. The community partners include Community Health Partnership of Illinois, Mexican Consulate of Chicago, the Illinois Migrant Council, Family Focus, and Mano a Mano Family Resource Center, among others. They are not co-sponsors but simply provide speakers who offer their services pro bono to FLAP. FLAP staff will conduct initial intake, in person or by telephone, with workers who attend the workshops and believe they have a valid case. The FLAP staff will refer potential plaintiffs to an attorney in FLAP’s network. FLAP will help migrant workers get back the wages that their employers owe them. This is money that migrant and seasonal workers need to educate and sustain their families. The approximate number of individuals to be served by this project in one year is 30,000. This includes all categories of migrant workers, farmworkers, landscape workers, packinghouse workers, cannery workers, and meat and poultry workers and their families, who work and/or live in an eighteen-county area of Northern Illinois. No other nonprofit provides this scope of legal education to all classes of workers in Illinois.","FLAP seeks to expand its presentation of Educacion Legal Comunitaria, or Community Legal Education workshops, throughout Northern Illinois because many immigrant, migrant, and seasonal workers in Northern Illinois are unfamiliar with labor laws, are not fluent in English, and prohibited from using federally-funded legal services. In general, 99 percent of FLAP constituents are Latino, with 90 percent male and 10 percent female. Eighty-five percent are adults (18 to 64 years old). The average farmworker-landscaper family earns between $10,000 and $14,000 a year. This special class of individuals is at higher risk of experiencing wage theft, unsafe working conditions, and other violations of their rights at work. Seeking justice begins with knowing one’s rights at work. By increasing the number of Community Legal Education workshops FLAP provides free-of-charge to Latino farmworkers and landscapers throughout Northern Illinois, HIP Give funding will empower more workers to come forward with legitimate work-related claims and receive the justice and restitution they deserve. Securing justice will lead to a better future for migrant workers and ensure that their work and home lives are safe, productive, and hopeful. FLAP predicts that as the number of victories for workers grows, abuses of low-wage immigrant, migrant, and seasonal workers will shrink.","$ 2,400 Promotor (wages): 160 hours per year @ $15/hour $ 1,600 Travel/Related Expenses $ 1,000 Laptop Computer, case and Microsoft Office Suite (for CLE presentations) $ 1,500 Marketing Materials (FLAP flyers and Business cards with educational information, CLE invitations) $ 900 Computer Projector and Carrying Case $ 750 Refreshments (sodas, cookies, snacks) $ 600 Attendance Incentives (hats, t-shirts, pens, cups, other FLAP contact information and logo merchandise) $ 500 Media Advertisement (for CLE events &#8211; print and radio) $ 500 Office Supplies for workshops $ 250 Printing Expense (CLE handout documents) $10,000","The mission of the Farmworker and Landscaper Advocacy Project is to improve working conditions for migrant and seasonal workers, including low-income farmworkers, landscapers, packinghouse workers, cannery workers, and meat and poultry workers in Northern Illinois.","FLAP provides quality legal representation at no financial cost to all categories of migrant workers, farmworkers, landscape workers, packinghouse workers, cannery workers, and meat and poultry workers and their families. It is one of only a few organizations in the United States that offers workers a continuum of pro bono assistance—from education to investigation of claims to litigation. As such, it is most closely aligned with the Immigrant Justice division of the Southern Poverty Law Center. FLAP’s constituent base is comprised of approximately 100,000 individuals who work and/or live in an eighteen-county area of Northern Illinois and who either do not have access to federally-funded legal assistance or cannot afford an attorney on their own. Counties served are Cook, Lake, DuPage, Will, Kane, Kendall, Grundy, LaSalle, DeKalb, McHenry, Boone, Winnebago, Ogle, Lee, Carroll, Whiteside, Stephenson, and Jo Daviess. This area, which comprises the top one-third of Illinois, stretches approximately 175 miles east to west and 85 miles north to south. FLAP’s services to its population include, but are not necessarily limited to: - Professional counsel, individual representation, and litigation services to Illinois agricultural and landscape workers with legal problems, especially issues relating to the workplace. - Legal assistance, advice, and training to community organizations, agencies, and churches that work on behalf of agricultural and landscape workers in Northern Illinois. - Protection of the civil and constitutional rights of agricultural and landscape workers against intrusion by government or private parties. - Promotion of the health, safety, and well-being of agricultural and landscape workers. - The same services listed above to workers in related industries, such as packinghouse workers, cannery workers, and meat and poultry workers. FLAP’s success speaks for itself. Since its founding in 1999, FLAP has filed more than 140 cases in court, 90 percent representing more than one worker. It has sent 40 demand letters and has recovered nearly $2 million in back wages for its clients. Fifty-two cases are in litigation and currently pending.

A key step to creating and sustaining this pipeline involves directly supporting Hispanic college students in the Milwaukee area. We accomplish this by providing opportunities for students to develop a range of skills, plan for a career, and connect with a network of professionals. Throughout the year, HPGM students participate in internship events, which allow them to meet recruiters from companies that match their academic and career path. They receive feedback on their resumes, practice their interviewing skills, and learn about upcoming internship opportunities. Multiple students secured summer internships after attending our first internship event in 2014. Our program also provides students with the chance to attend local and national conferences related to Hispanic talent development, including the United States Hispanic Leadership Institute (USHLI) and League of United Latin American Citizen (LULAC). One of our promising undergraduate students, Zac, shared this insight about his experience at USHLI: “Leaving this phenomenal conference, I couldn’t help but smile and take pride in the fact that people are truly invested in our future. Listening to the most influential Hispanic leaders in our country, our organization’s members have become more ambitious, passionate, and focused on our goals. “ The unique experiences offered by our College to Career program help empower our undergraduate students to make meaningful progress toward their goals, by stepping out of their comfort zone, learning new things, and securing a professional internship. With a stronger pipeline of ambitious young professionals, Hispanics can have a greater impact on the direction of Milwaukee’s future business and cultural landscape. With more opportunities for education, growth and leadership, the young population of Milwaukee is more likely to stay and build a life in our city after graduation.","HPGM student programming was born out of a visible and expressed need among Hispanic college students in the Milwaukee area for professional development, which they were not finding through their colleges or universities. We began our efforts with three Milwaukee universities, and have since added two more, with the promise of seven by the end of 2015. HPGM student initiatives also work to address a need expressed by local companies and organizations: how to find and retain diverse and qualified employees. HPGM wants to expand our programming to focus on connecting these employers with candidates of choice. In 2015, students will attend trainings, workshops and recruitment events, with the chance to secure a position in their desired field of study. We will work with our corporate, non-profit, and small business partners, to ensure that student candidates are the right fit and align with the student’s professional goals. With these experiences, students will be a step ahead when they graduate with a purpose and begin searching for employment in the Milwaukee area. After earning their degree, they will contribute to the formation of a dynamic and sustainable professional workforce.","We are requesting a budget of $20,000 for our student initiative. In order to offer participation in a wider range of partner events, we request $6,000 for national and regional conference registration fees, $2,000 for transportation, and $2,000 for hotel accommodations. To coordinate and execute workshops and trainings on topics such as resume building, professional etiquette, and informational interviewing, we request $2,000. To engage influential professionals and speakers, we request $2,000 for speaker fees. HPGM would also like to support their most active student members by providing assistance with payment for professional attire and business cards, for which we require $3,000. Finally, to support the Program Manager and enhance outreach, we request $2,000 for the HPGM portion of an intern stipend and $1,000 for marketing costs.","Hispanic Professionals of Greater Milwaukee Mission Statement: To create a dynamic environment for Hispanic professionals to thrive by fostering leadership, mentoring, education, networking, and new initiatives that support Hispanics and Hispanic businesses.","In 2001, HPGM was formed with the vision of showcasing Hispanic talent in the Milwaukee area and providing professionals with the support they needed to reach increasing levels of success in their careers.

As first generation college students in our Escalera program, many of our students have never been to a college campus or seen a college dorm. These future college students often face many barriers to college visits−including transportation, campus contacts, and someone to accompany them. After a college visit students can better visualize their life on campus and choose a school that is a good fit for their academic and personal goals. The “Escalera: Taking Steps to Success” program developed by the National Council of La Raza (NCLR) promotes economic mobility for immigrant and refugee youth by increasing educational attainment, career planning, and access to information about professional careers. Students in this program receive academic support to graduate from high school, entrance exam preparation, support to apply to three post-secondary institutions, multiple college visits, and an 80-hour internship in their field of study. We are currently implementing the Escalera Program at Glencliff High School with first-generation immigrant and refugee students who will be the first in their families to go to college, and will soon be expanding to other schools in Nashville.","Students in our program often lack the resources to visit colleges, limiting their educational options. Visiting colleges allows students to visualize themselves on campus and see what college life is like. Meeting with professors and student leaders helps students find the college that is the right fit for their academic and personal goals. In the nationwide Escalera program 88% of students enrolled program have successfully completed the program and graduated from high school, compared to 73% nationwide for Hispanic students (Pew Hispanic Center). Of those Escalera graduates, 87% enrolled in post secondary institutions (compared to 44% nationwide for Hispanic high school graduates).","College visits for 100+ immigrant and refugee high school students to visit four different colleges.

In keeping with First Lady’s Michelle Obama’s “Let’s Move” anti-obesity campaign, the Children’s Wellness Center’s aim is to reduce and prevent childhood obesity, and other chronic conditions like diabetes and high blood pressure, by improving access to physical activity, healthy foods, community gardens, cooking classes, and family-oriented exercise classes. That being said, the foundation of the Center is cognitive and creative learning so as to ensure the intellectual growth and development of young children. Designed to serve upward of 5,000 children ages 0-12 and their families each year, the facility is the only one of its kind in an urban community that is accessible to poor and low-income families, including its rapidly growing Latino population. Its comprehensive approach, which embraces the “whole” child, has the potential to address the complex web of factors leading to language delays, lack of preparedness for school and poor nutrition/general wellness. As such, the Center promises to become a model for children’s wellness in poor urban communities throughout the region. Early childhood education: Hands-on, age-appropriate, child development “centers” that help to foster cognitive learning, fine/gross motor skill development and creative thinking. Child developmental screening at regular intervals to identify areas of deficiency, document progress and educate parents about keeping children on track. Early Screening Profile assessments (includes testing of gross motor skills) Education/referral for immunizations Fitness: Activity “centers” offering age-appropriate equipment, training, and movement for young children Workshops in infant massage, yoga, music and creative movement, family Zumba, dance, and martial arts. Outdoor activities in adjacent City park, to include tumbling, balancing, tricycle and bicycle riding, jungle gyms, swings, ropes, etc. Family physical fitness classes Nutrition: A full-scale kitchen that serves as a teaching center for families about good nutrition, healthy food preparation techniques, and what foods to avoid. Parent-child cooking classes, canning and freezing parties, preserving foods, pantry makeovers, etc. Hands-on teaching of indoor gardening, including hydroponics A community garden with raised beds for herbs and vegetables, access to small plots of land, education about growing fresh foods. Access to free, fresh foods through bi-weekly visits by the mobile Foodshare truck and linkages with area farmers/farms. &nbsp;","There is a dangerous overlap between poverty, hunger, low food security and obesity. Cognitive learning is also adversely impacted by these factors. What follows are some key facts illustrating this point: 47% of Hartford children live below the federal poverty line, the highest rate in Connecticut cities Connecticut household food insecurity rose by 27% between 1999-2001, and between 2002-2004. 40,000 households, the majority in Connecticut cities, have experienced hunger in conjunction with food insecurity within a 12-month period. In summertime, only 25% of Connecticut children who eat a free or reduced price meal at school get a meal. Hartford children are NOT prepared for school. Poor students enter Kindergarten with a 400 word vocabulary; a middle class student enters with about a 1,000 word vocabulary. Due to the quality of food consumed coupled with lack of physical activity, unsafe neighborhoods and the absence of public spaces for young children, childhood obesity rates have skyrocketed, particularly in urban communities. Nationally, there is an epidemic of childhood obesity among Latinos and African-Americans, which, without intervention, will follow them into adulthood. In Hartford, the situation is parallel: 42% of Hartford three-year-olds are obese or at risk of obesity Children who are obese at age 4 have a four-fold likelihood of being obese as adults. For children who are obese at age 10, the risk is 28-fold to become obese as adults. Physical activity among children is critical because of the related health&#8211;and learning&#8211; benefits, such as cardio-respiratory function, blood pressure control, weight management, cognitive development, problem-solving and emotional growth. Delayed development, including poor development of gross motor skills and cognitive growth, are other consequences of obesity. Data from six citywide Brighter Futures family centers for last year showed that 54% of children had poor gross motor skills. At our own family center in the Parkville neighborhood, 51% of children had a developmental issue warranting referral to the State’s Birth-to-Three Program. Already, an average child growing up in a low-income family hears one-half to one-third as many words as a child from a more affluent family, meaning the brain is not being stimulated to its full potential and language development is compromised. Though a clear relationship between obesity and academic performance has not yet been established, studies have identified a link between childhood obesity and self-esteem, which is often related to low academic achievement and attainment. Combined with lack of access to fresh produce, poor nutrition, and lack of exercise, obese and overweight children are not prepared to start school. Consequently, many will have difficulties succeeding in school, work, and life. According to the National Institute for Literacy, “oral language development is a critical foundation for reading, writing, and spelling, and it is the ‘engine’ of learning and thinking.” Research tells us that oral language development includes critical skills that make it possible for children to communicate, understand the meaning of words and concepts they hear and read, obtain new information, and express ideas using specific language. These skills are essential for lifelong thinkers and learners. (Learning to Talk and Listen, 2010) Nobel Laureate economist James Heckman (2007) provides another rationale for investing in high quality early childhood education programs. Citing societal impact and a strong return on investment, he underscores the crucial role of early intervention programs in empowering young learners and closing the achievement gap. In short, the fundamental basis for children’s wellness is cognitive learning, growth and development.","Children&#8217;s Wellness Center Budget Flooring, Bathrooms, Heating, Fire Safety Main Educational/Wellness Space -install wall outlets and rewire entire space 5,000 &#8211; purchase/install overhead lighting 5,000 -purchase/install &#8220;sprung&#8221; floor (durable, cushioned flooring for athletics/dance) 25,000 -purchase/install padding on four interior cement pillars 1,500 36,500 Bathrooms -obtain permits 1,000 -reconfigure space for 2 bathrooms (girls &amp; boys) 2,500 -install fixtures for 2 sinks &amp; 2 toilets in each bathroom 2,000 -install drop ceiling 4,000 -purchase/install lighting 4,000 -install sheetrock &amp; paint 2,500 -install heavy duty vinyl flooring 3,500 -purchase/install heavy duty bathroom stalls 2,000 21,500 Heating -purchase/install ducts throughout space 15,000 Fire Safety Fire alarms, carbon monoxide detectors, other fire safety equipment 2,000 Total: 75,000",Building a stronger community by fostering partnerships that engage families in a participatory process leading to self-efficacy.,"Mission, history and major developments Founded in 1987 to address the devastating impact of pregnancy on low-income Puerto Rican teens in Hartford’s Frog Hollow neighborhood, Family Life Education (FLE) is an independent non-profit organization that strives to empower city families to transform circumstances of poverty into opportunities for growth, learning and self-efficacy. Our mission is building a stronger community by fostering partnerships that engage families in a participatory process leading to self-efficacy. Specifically, we help at-risk families to develop the confidence and skills to chart their own life courses, on their own terms. To accomplish these aims, FLE provides leadership development, culturally sensitive parenting education, developmental assessment/child care, peer mentoring, counseling, outreach and support. Services are geared to families, children and youth throughout the city. The majority are of Latino heritage, including first and second generation Puerto Ricans, as well as immigrants from Latin/Central America. Recently, the organization implemented a new service delivery model that assists youth, parents and families to attain their full potential. To be infused through all of our programs, the model emphasizes self-awareness, personal responsibility and empowerment as critical first steps in achieving self-efficacy. To avoid dependency, FLE avoids participants repeating program cycles, thereby encouraging them to go on to the next stage of their personal development, whether a job, a GED program, vocational training, or saving to rent a better apartment. Ultimately, the aim is to support them in taking charge of their own and their children’s lives, and to develop the critical thinking and problem solving skills needed to become productive, responsible and engaged citizens. Continued support is offered to those who desire it after the program engagement period ends. FLE’s constituency stretches across low-income communities in more than 15 nearby towns in the 29-town area, with the majority (98%) residing in Hartford. Towns include, among others: Bloomfield, East Hartford, Windsor, Manchester and West Hartford. Our doors are open to anyone in need; we do not turn anyone away. Facility Space The Children’s Wellness Center will be located in the Parkville neighborhood, which is Hartford’s most ethnically diverse. It will be housed in 4,000 sq. feet on the ground floor of 30 Arbor Street South, immediately underneath FLE’s administrative offices. The space has abundant sunlight, with large windows that were recently installed by the property owner. The HVAC system was also recently updated by the property owner, meaning heating and cooling will be available year-round. Finally, the property owners have floated a new cement floor. Overall, they have invested roughly $150,000 in the space because of their enthusiasm about the project and its role in local economic development. The facility will have two entrances, and full handicap accessibility. Formerly a storage area without insulation or heat, the space must undergo full renovations in order to be used as a Children’s Wellness Center. Already, $125,000 has been raised. We need to raise an additional $75,000 to complete renovations. Collaborating Organizations Over the past year, Family Life Education has worked with many different organizations and institutions in the planning and development of the Children’s Wellness Center. While some have visited our location and met with staff, others have committed to provide services within the Center, which will mean lowered staffing costs for the facility. All continue to support the successful establishment of the Center. These entities are as follows: The ThinkWell Center University of Connecticut Agricultural Extension Program Cooking Matters My City Kitchen Windowfarms Garden Project Connecticut Children’s Medical Center Hartford Children’s Wellness Alliance Hartford Food System Department of Children, Families, Youth and Recreation, City of Hartford Department of Health and Human Services, City of Hartford Dept. of Anthropology, University of Connecticut Institute for Community Research 30 Arbor Street, LLC (property owners) Because cognitive learning is the most important pillar of the new Children’s Wellness Center, this program is conceived as a permanent one going forward. Thus, FLE is committed to raising funds that will sustain it. Already, we have won the support of Congressman John Larson, Dr. Myra Jones-Taylor, Commissioner of the Ct. Office of Early Childhood, and Dr. José Colon, head of the City’s Dept. of Children, Families, Youth and Recreation. Mayor Segarra has endorsed the project, and committed $50,000 to the last phase of renovations. Our intention is to seek program support from the Administration of Children, Youth and Families, the U.S. Dept. of Education, and the Ct. Dept. of Education. In addition, we intend to explore opportunities from national foundations like Edna McConnell Clark, Ford, and Kellogg. FLE has a strong base of support from the faith-based community that will be tapped, as well as an active body of volunteers from the corporate sector and general public. They will be enlisted to undertake fundraisers, mail solicitations, and establish a “Friends of the Children’s Wellness Center” group. Finally, the facility is designed to generate income through rentals for birthday parties, cultural celebrations, workshops and other events. Last, our board is discussing the possibility of opening a consignment shop to garner revenue for the Children’s Wellness Center.",ended,20150225.0,,

They embarked in a dangerous journey through Mexico, and ended up incarcerated in the U.S. detention centers, after that the Immigration Enforcement Agency reallocated them into Refugee Centers until they were finally released to their parents/legal guardians. But their hopes and dreams of starting a new life free from violence have been challenged during a complex transitioning and reintegration process, when they unified with their family or relatives they had not seen in over a decade, new schools where they didn’t know anyone nor the language and feel alienated. and the reality that many of these neighborhoods they came to live in lack the proper health systems. They are coping with anxiety, depression, and PSTD. Organizations in Los Angeles like CARECEN and Saint St. John’s Well Child Center among others stepped forward and do great work; providing they help for their trauma, others served them with their immigration legal process. Homies Unidos is helping them with the culture shock they are experiencing in their schools and with their families. Homies Unidos started reaching out to schools and community service providers to refer any youth who needs mental health or legal services. As part of a preventive strategy we began implementing the Joven Noble, character development program to provide a safe space where they can express themselves through indigenous traditional teaching tools. Even though, our limited resources we have served over 58 youth in four different schools: Santee High, Hawthorne High, Hawkins High and L.A. River. Through this Conference we will address the need to bring youth from other schools who are not benefiting with these services, where they can share experiences and be introduced to health service providers and other resources. Finally, we need to ensure these youth have a successful, healthy, safe, and well-supported integration to our communities. Therefore, in solidarity with Central American refugees, Homies Unidos is proposing to put together the first locally accessible&nbsp;Central American Youth Conference. The main purpose will be to ensure that these refugee youth feel welcomed, introduced to service providers and to celebrate and promote Central American art and culture. Goals Our conference main goals look to, Revitalize our support and welcoming the Central American youth and their families who fled violence and economic hardship in their country of origin and now are refugees in the U.S. and, Connect Central American youth with resources provided by organizations in; legal services, mental health, education and violence prevention. Produce a resolution from our youth to ensure their refugee status automatically entitled to asylum, education, health, and decent work. As a result of this conference organized by our Central American youth would have graduated from our summer Youth Leadership Training, we will have learned together to organize around the health disparities based in the social determinants of health, in their communities and will become part of a larger component of the Youth Refugee Council. Overall, Central American youth from various schools will benefit from the health resources and cultural activities provided by organizations, endorsers, funders, and the youth themselves; which eventually would create opportunities for positive feedback, health referral system and self-esteem building for CAR youth, in the long run towards more support from the main community stakeholders.","Currently, recent support for immigrant children and youth is fading and is not being prioritized. In that context the extremely difficult reality of the Central American Immigrant Youth&mdash;in the invironment of the mental conflict of Integration, PTSD symptoms, the effects of displacement, language barriers, and the lack of tools, resources, and education about these issues.&nbsp; The families, shelter or school staff, are not able to reach or support this population without effectively building culturally relevant approaches and interventions. &ldquo;In Los Angeles, the school district&#39;s mental-health director, Pia Escudero, reviewed records for students entering a newcomer school there; she found that 94 percent of those given mental-health screenings reported at least three traumatic events, and 65 percent had clinical symptoms&quot; in the range of PTSD and depression.&quot; They experience hyper arousal and hyper alertness, and everyday urban sounds&mdash;say, a helicopter passing overhead&mdash;can trigger flashbacks.&rdquo;[1] The above history brings down the fact that immigrant children would be at risk of gang violence involvement, their borrow families would not know how to deal with them and it is not wild to assure that most schools will not know what to do with this population.&nbsp; Their needs are very different from the rest of the &ldquo;regular&rdquo; class.&nbsp; The current infrastructure lacks a plan to divert the youth from gangs, and law enforcement does not provide protection of this highly vulnerable population.&nbsp; Additionally, community members express distrust of law enforcement&rsquo;s overly harsh responses and fear that police collaborate with immigration authorities; while at the same time, law enforcement and police officers express frustration that they &ldquo;are unable to take proactive steps to build relationships in the community&rdquo;. Simultaneously, the increasing number of deportations is incrementing the number of family separations and launches low-income-to extremely low-income families into dire economic hardship. The impact of loss and economic pressure is experienced in behavioral changes in older children who have had parents deported or incarcerated which often include: increase in aggression, PTSD symptoms (particularly if they witnessed their parents being arrested from inside the home); increased criminal activity; inter-community violence; juvenile incarceration (and getting caught in the vicious cycle of recidivism); and self-destructive behaviors such as substance abuse, teen pregnancy, domestic violence, self-injury, self-mutilation, and suicide. Historically, the consequence of not creating a plan to support and welcome refugees has created plenty to draw from to reconsider as the best opportunity to overcome the lack of planning, involved traditional and new stakeholders from the communities. &nbsp;&nbsp; [1] Mother Jones magazine (Ian Gordon &#8211; 70,000 kids will show up alone at our border this year. What happens to them? | Tue Jun. 3, 2014)",,"To achieve this, Homies Unidos works to end violence and promote peace in our communities by empowering youth and their families to become advocates for social justice rather than agents of self-destruction. We offer an alternative vision to incarceration, deportation, and repressive and ineffective zero-tolerance “gang abatement” and “band-aid” social service strategies. Instead, Homies Unidos presents culturally competent access to alternative education, leadership development, self-esteem building, and health education programs tied to social justice advocacy programs that make a difference in the streets and homes of our community.","CURRENT STATUS Out of many accomplishments Homies Unidos’ programs are organized in coalition with help from our Youth Leadership graduates: Youth Leadership Development - In July we held a forum: Child refugees, Understanding the Crisis and since then we have organized weekly meeting and rallies. On Oct. 4 a concert called, Vos Sos Mi Canto, to raise more awareness. Joven Noble - No one was prepared for the 90,000 Central American Immigrant Children. To address the issue of immigrant culture clash experience these youth will face, collectively created the Joven Noble curriculum. In June we graduated 20 youth (English Language Development class) at Hawthorne High School. The Epiphany Project - It was created for at-risk and gang involved youth, a 12-week life-skills building program for “at-risk” and gang involved youth involved in participating agencies. In 2013 we trained 14 youth to organize a Know Your Rights seminar in MacArthur Park. Incarceration Reform – as we mention above ASAPLE was able to successfully present 25 cases in which people incarcerated showed that once they get released to El Salvador they will have the necessary support in getting employment, Alcoholic Anonymous and religious services. We have continued our advocacy for legislation that would prevent the vicious cycle of violence that traps youth. Such as educating our community about SB982 and AB1652, through two forums conducted in the community or through media. These bills which addresses the concerns of solitary confinement in the prisons in California. We have partner with Families to Abolish Solitary Confinement in their efforts to free their families from this torturous conditions. Homies Unidos, as an organization rooted within the hearth of the community, has never step aside for major issues that have impacted negatively the community, just like the Central American Children, which is not only an immigration issue but also a criminal justice problem, where the Children have been criminalized. Consequently they are facing bigger challenges, being at risk of violence outside the system. The biggest concern would be what happens to the children once they go off the courts and the Office of Refugee Resettlement (OOR) radar? There is not liable data! Incarceration Reform - Elizza Jurado from the Salvadoran Association of People Deprived of Freedom (ASAPLE) and Homies Unidos have been working together with incarcerated people in the prisons of California for the last eight years. Homies provides families information about their rights, civic participation, and advocacy. Since 2013 Homies took a group of families accompanied by the El Salvadoran consulate to Sacramento to meet with a representative of the Governor’s office and CDCR officials, 3 family members expressed their concerns about their love ones denial of parole for not having the support packages from El Salvador they need to gain their liberty, out of it 25 cases were presented and all of them gained their freedom. One step at a time, Homies Unidos is still standing against all odds. This organization nature embraces all human beings and stands for them; the outcast, the rejected and worse that of all, those young individuals at their very critical human development stage, individuals thriving to be, and in great need to fit, to belong, making them easy targets of “logical” violent activities and behaviors. The system judge and incarcerate theirs whole soul and future with no exit but become more violent. But what is worse whenever redemption knocks their hearts, the opportunities are scarce and focus in their mistakes placed out of context, which in many case leads to setbacks. Homies Unidos have never rejected them and by joining several community, regional and national efforts, keeps reminding the social justice movement that thousand of our youth need their attention. Consequently the organization has served over 6700 youth and parents through presentations and workshops in schools, community centers, and conferences. We developed two cornerstone programs that are interlinked to create opportunities for at-risk, gang-involved youth and their immigrant families to take control of their lives, neighborhoods and advocates for social change and justice to influence public policy. Our efforts have been widely reported in local, national and international media (NPR, TV Azteca, Nation Magazine, Univision, etc.). During this year we have able to put our Youth Leadership Training graduates to help us put together nine events in to educate the community on the issues we are working on while developing our base to speak in public: The organization took part of the International Women’s Day with Global Women’s Strike. On July 8th it was celebrated one year Anniversary of the California prison Hunger Strike, which forced the California Senate and Assembly to write two bills addressing solitary confinement. These efforts will continue to push for the bills to pass both houses and also being signed into law. Dia de los Muertos in Echo Park, Documentary “Fruits of War” screenings, Close Down The School of The Americas, “We want Peace in El Salvador, let’s give Our Youth a Chance”, Homies Unidos14th anniversary and a play called “Placas, The Most Dangerous Tattoo” which is partially based on our Executive Director’s life.

CAR Youth have been dealing with violence since they lived in their country of origin, which they were forced to emigrate. They embarked in a dangerous journey through Mexico, and ended up incarcerated in the U.S. detention centers, after that the Immigration Enforcement Agency reallocated them into Refugee Centers until they were finally released to their parents/legal guardians. But their hopes and dreams of starting a new life free from violence have been challenged during a complex transitioning and reintegration process, when they unified with their family or relatives they had not seen in over a decade, new schools where they didn’t know anyone nor the language and feel alienated. and the reality that many of these neighborhoods they came to live in lack the proper health systems. They are coping with anxiety, depression, and PSTD. Organizations in Los Angeles like CARECEN and Saint St. John’s Well Child Center among others stepped forward and do great work; providing they help for their trauma, others served them with their immigration legal process. Homies Unidos is helping them with the culture shock they are experiencing in their schools and with their families. Homies Unidos started reaching out to schools and community service providers to refer any youth who needs mental health or legal services. As part of a preventive strategy we began implementing the Joven Noble, character development program to provide a safe space where they can express themselves through indigenous traditional teaching tools. Even though, our limited resources we have served over 58 youth in four different schools: Santee High, Hawthorne High, Hawkins High and L.A. River. Through this Conference we will address the need to bring youth from other schools who are not benefiting with these services, where they can share experiences and be introduced to health service providers and other resources. Finally, we need to ensure these youth have a successful, healthy, safe, and well-supported integration to our communities. Therefore, in solidarity with Central American refugees, Homies Unidos is proposing to put together the first locally accessible Central American Youth Conference. The main purpose will be to ensure that these refugee youth feel welcomed, introduced to service providers and to celebrate and promote Central American art and culture. Goals Our conference main goals look to, Revitalize our support and welcoming the Central American youth and their families who fled violence and economic hardship in their country of origin and now are refugees in the U.S. and, Connect Central American youth with resources provided by organizations in; legal services, mental health, education and violence prevention. Produce a resolution from our youth to ensure their refugee status automatically entitled to asylum, education, health, and decent work. As a result of this conference organized by our Central American youth would have graduated from our summer Youth Leadership Training, we will have learned together to organize around the health disparities based in the social determinants of health, in their communities and will become part of a larger component of the Youth Refugee Council. Overall, Central American youth from various schools will benefit from the health resources and cultural activities provided by organizations, endorsers, funders, and the youth themselves; which eventually would create opportunities for positive feedback, health referral system and self-esteem building for CAR youth, in the long run towards more support from the main community stakeholders.","Homies Unidos has advocated for just policies to deal with the issue of violence that plagues not just the streets of Los Angeles but also the streets of Central America. We will be joining School of The Americas Watch Vigil in their mission to close down this school who has trained many dictators and assassins throughout Latin America. These atrocities that’s happened primarily in Central America were the reason over 1.8 million Salvadorans live outside of their country and thousands, now children continue to flee. Once again the U.S. foreign immigration, war on drug and economic policies has driven over 63,000 Central American children to the U.S. border just in 2014. These children became known as the “Unaccompanied Minors”. These youth are in our communities and are having difficulties integrating in the school system, with their parents they have not seen in years and they have come to live in communities where there is in large amounts of violence. Homies Unidos has been working with these youth in their schools through our rites of passage, Joven Noble program. As part of The Joven Noble program youth qualify for our summer Youth Leadership Training on civic engagement, community organizing and advocacy, we will take four youth who have graduated from our programs to Columbus, GA where they will speak to a group of thousands of participants about their journey as undocumented youth and how violence from the 80&#8217;s is reverent to today’s violence in Central America. We will be screening our Fruits of War documentary and educating people from all parts of the U.S. about the work that Homies Unidos does to reduce violence and what’s happening in Central America at the hands of military that continues to be trained in the School of Americas. Our youth will present, take part of the workshops, the rallies and meet other youth advocates from around the country. Once they get back to Los Angeles will develop a report of their experience which will be shared with other youth and will be placed on our website. By getting these youth involved in Human Rights, advocacy and community organizing these youth will be able to understand the reasons they had to forced migrate and understand their parent’s reasons for migrating and leaving them behind. We are creating leaders of our youth who at one point where disfranchised and now are developing into advocates for social justice.","Youth Leadership Field Trip School of the Americas Budget &#8211; 2015 ADMINISTRATION COST 400 TRAVELERS X5 1750 HOUSING ROOMS X3 240 FOOD/ MEALS/SNACKS 500 SUPPLIES, EQUIPMENT 150 INDIRECT COST 100 POSTAGE, PRINTING, 20 TSHIRTS, 20 DVD’S 250 TOTAL BUDGET 3,310",,"Homies Unidos has served over 6700 youth and parents through presentations and workshops in schools, community centers, and conferences.

It is not only immoral but also possibly unconstitutional for children and vulnerable persons to face deportation without a trained lawyer or public defender in today&#8217;s United States. Through this project, ILCM will provide free legal advice to low-income children and single parents who have no money to pay private attorneys, guaranteeing their best possibility to permanently remain in the U.S. and finally escape the terrible violence of their home countries. In addition to providing children with lawyers, ILCM will use its expertise and connections to inform state and federal policy makers on how to improve laws and systems to reduce this crisis, and work to make the U.S. response one based on dignity, respect, and long-term solutions.","ILCM is the Minnesota region&#8217;s largest provider of free legal services for low-income Latinos. Consequently, our organization is being asked to lead the legal and policy responses to best serve the children and families attempting to immigrate from Central America. The funding from this campaign will grow our capacity to respond to the needs of such groups, especially unaccompanied minors, in a timely fashion. As some of these cases will possibly take many years to complete, it will also help to sustain the work for the long-term. Current Central American refugees are generally low-income, cannot afford private attorneys, and many have ties to the Minnesota area (175 have already relocated in 2014). Through this campaign, ILCM can prove to the state of Minnesota, and to the children and families arriving here, that there are many people and systems in place which understand the challenging situations of Central American immigrants. What is more, it will demonstrate that those people are willing to do everything possible to give them protection, healing, and the ability to begin safer and healthier lives.","The overall budget in year one is $50,000 (.50 FTE legal representation; .10 FTE policy support).","The Immigrant Law Center of Minnesota enhances opportunities for immigrants and refugees through legal representation for low-income individuals, and through education and advocacy with diverse communities.","The Immigrant Law Center of Minnesota enhances opportunities for immigrants and refugees through legal representation for low-income individuals, and through education and advocacy with diverse communities.",ended,20140820.0,ILCM_MN,

For more than 30 years, CARECEN has been advocating for, providing legal services to, and organizing Central Americans and Latinos in Los Angeles. As the number of unaccompanied minors detained at the border rises as the violence and hopelessness grows in their countries of origin, we realize these could be the grandchildren of those civil war refugees who founded CARECEN. They are the heart of our community. We want to raise $15,000 to help hire a dedicated CARECEN attorney so we can take on these children&#8217;s cases. It&#8217;s estimated that without legal representation, up to 90 percent of the children are sent back to their home countries to face out-of-control violence from drug gangs. However, with legal representation, it is estimated that up to 70 percent may have a credible claim to asylum. With a dedicated attorney, CARECEN believes it can take up to 50 more cases of unaccompanied children, thus vastly improving their chances of winning asylum.

Through these efforts, Taller will advance its goals and promote cultural developments which enhance quality of life, especially by motivating promising young people to assess and develop their talents despite social and economic obstacles.","Community demand continues to grow. To meet it, Taller Puertorriqueño must move to a new location: Taller owns and occupies two townhouses on North 5th Street. These properties are two blocks apart, creating ongoing operational issues and public confusion. The buildings are old and inadequate for their purpose, and rehabilitation would be prohibitively expensive. Neither building is fully wheelchair accessible. The gallery and classrooms are on the second floor. There are no reasonable opportunities to install elevators. The buildings do not meet code requirements that are prerequisites for program expansion. The demand for children’s programs is beyond our space capacity. The current galleries are not adequate- too long and too narrow- prohibiting exhibition of large objects or objects that should be viewed from a distance. The gallery is also too small to accommodate school groups, a significant component of our outreach efforts, and a source of earned income. The multi-use theatre is very small, poorly configured, and not properly equipped. Lack of parking is a barrier to increased participation; there is no space to drop off or pick up young children. Action is necessary now! In December 2007, the City of Philadelphia transferred to Taller Puertorriqueño a 2 ¼ acre parcel on the corner of 5th and Huntingdon Streets.

(Taller) is a community based cultural organization whose primary purpose is to preserve, develop and promote Puerto Rican arts and culture, grounded in the conviction that embracing one’s cultural heritage is central to community empowerment. Taller is also committed to the representation and support of other Latino cultural expressions and our common roots.","Founded in 1974 by Latino artists and activists in the North Kensington area of Philadelphia, Taller Puertorriqueño (Taller) stands as testament to the wealth of possibilities created when citizens see a need in their community and decide to meet it. Discouraged by the absence of outlets for Barrio youth desperate to channel their artistic talents, Taller’s founders created a community-based graphic arts workshop to provide cultural training alternatives to local youth. The idea of passing along traditional culture to help empower young people through pride in their heritage was and remains central to this workshop. Today, in Philadelphia’s Barrio and throughout the region, Taller Puertorriqueño is a force for change, building community through art. Taller’s programs have expanded to include the following: Cultural Exploration Program introduces young students to renowned local artists, performers, and educators who guide the children on a year-long journey of self-discovery. The program encourages self-expression through classes in traditional disciplines such as folkloric dance, salsa, drama, ceramics, painting, and printmaking. Youth Artists Program is a two-year program for talented high school sophomores, juniors, and seniors. With the guidance of professional artist mentors, students develop their artistic skills and produce a solid portfolio of work they can use to apply to highly-competitive arts colleges and universities. Graduates of this program have gone on to the Moore College of Art and Design, The Philadelphia Art Institute, and Arcadia University, among others. Visítenos is a program in which K-12 grade students engage in creative exploration of Latino cultures through videos of traditional dances, music, and hands-on experiences withvejigante masks, drawing and painting, dance, t-shirt decorating, as well as through long-term arts residencies in schools. These experiences meet the criteria of Philadelphia School District Arts Standards and Multicultural Competencies, and promote self-understanding, self-respect, and appreciation for cultural diversity. Memories in the Making is an innovative art therapy program that enables persons with dementia from the Hispanic/Latino community, for whom linguistic and cultural differences present additional barriers, to express themselves through art. The Delaware Valley Chapter of the Alzheimer’s Association joined efforts with Taller to meet this need. The Eugenio Maria de Hostos Archives is a resource center that includes a varied collection of books, periodicals, articles, oral histories and research—often out of print--focusing on Latino culture and history. The Archives are a resource for students and scholars. The Lorenzo Homar Gallery is the region’s only art gallery dedicated to Latin American and Caribbean art, many of the exhibitions highlighting contemporary artists from the region. The Julia de Burgos Gift Shop is a destination for original Latino artwork, crafts, handmade jewelry and collectibles and serves as the only bilingual bookstore of its kind in the tri-state area. Augmenting the store is an ongoing series of book readings and author presentations. The annual Arturo Schomburg Symposium brings scholars from around the globe to Taller for conversations such as the 2013 presentation, ""Messages: Children's Identity Formation and Representation of Blackness.” Taller is now the largest and most established Latino arts and cultural organization in the Philadelphia region. Within our building, we serve more than 3,000 people annually, with tens of thousands more attracted to our concerts, street fairs and outdoor celebrations.",ended,20140411.0,tallerpr,

This specialized component has proven results and continues to witness increased in strength and credibility as a direct response to the crisis noted in countless studies and most recently forming the basis for President Obama’s commitment in the My Brother’s Keeper Initiative. The goals of the project are to provide a growing number of Latino young males with: Development of a community that provides a greater sense of self, builds a sense of belonging and connectedness that contribute to confidence and resiliency Provision of a comprehensive college/career curriculum Access to higher education through a large network of colleges/universities Increased funding for education through scholarships and grants Support services to ensure academic, personal success in college Access to an exclusive Career Center to provide ongoing career readiness support services Provision of a member network among participants Provision of ongoing professional development activities, information and resources Development of a Scholarship Program specific to AGUILA Men of Honor created by Alumnae for students who follow their lead Establishment of a Mentoring Program of Alumnae with incoming participants","AGUILA Men of Honor was developed as a component of AGUILA Youth Leadership Institute (AGUILA) in 2006 in response to the crisis in the academic achievement gap of young men of color with the goal of increasing high school graduation rates; college preparation, access and graduation rates; career development and civic engagement. CEO/Founder, Rosemary Ybarra-Hernandez’s doctoral research with Latino Gangs formed the impetus for the development of AGUILA and most importantly, including gender-specific components that addressed issues for both young women and men.

Thousands of unaccompanied children are living in these parts of the country. They are in deportation proceedings. The government does not provide attorneys to represent them. They need your help. We need to raise $10,000, so that we can assign Child Advocates to reach these kids and advocate for their best interests while they are subject to deportation. Our government wants to accelerate deportation hearings for unaccompanied minors, which will place many at risk of being sent back to dangerous situations in home country. These children are alone, and they face an immigration system that treats them like adults. Help the Young Center assign Child Advocates to children in need in these three new sites, so they have a champion and trusted ally by their side, protecting their best interests: safety and welfare. Child Advocates are bilingual, and often bicultural volunteers who work one-on-one with individual unaccompanied immigrant children, spending time with them, learning their stories, and figuring out what they want. After the kids get released from immigration detention, our Child Advocates remain on the case, helping find attorneys, getting kids enrolled in schools, and ensuring that immigration judges and officials hear what’s in the child’s best interests. If a child is at risk of being repatriated, the Young Center and the Child Advocate figure out what, if anything, the child has to return to, and make sure that the government receives that information before there’s a final decision. Help us fight for the rights of these children at the front lines, to be witnesses and champions during their time in our unforgiving immigration system. Your support will help us raise the funds to deploy teams of Child Advocates to reach the many children now living in New York, Houston, and the D.C. metropolitan area.","The Young Center&#8217;s goal is to ensure that immigration authorities attend to the best interests of unaccompanied immigrant children in any decision, particularly a decision about deportation. The Young Center headquarters is in Chicago. We have a project in the Rio Grande Valley in Texas, where most of the children are apprehended. And in 2014, we are opening offices in New York, Houston and Washington, D.C. Seventy thousand children are expected to cross into the U.S. this year, most of them from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador. This represents an enormous surge in arrivals; from 2006 to 2011 an estimated 8,000 unaccompanied children crossed the border each year. The reasons are tangled, unrelenting violence in their home countries, political instability, severe and widespread poverty, and a desire for family reunification. Many of the children are younger than 13, some as young as 4 and 5. Once in immigration custody, they are transferred to secure facilities around the country, where the government tries to reunify them with family in the U.S. The children are placed in deportation proceedings and expected to argue their case, demonstrating to the immigration judge their eligibility to stay in the U.S. They face a government attorney, but they are not guaranteed an attorney unless they can pay one or find a pro bono lawyer. Many will end up going to court alone. The immigration court system treats children like adults, ignoring the &#8220;best interests of the child&#8221; standard that is paramount in U.S. domestic decisions involving children; this standard is meant to consider the safety, security, and wishes of the child. There is no best interests standard in immigration law, no requirement that judges consider what&#8217;s best for the child before them even though the decisions can carry life and death consequences. The government has announced that it will soon accelerate the cases, and require children to proceed with their deportation hearings completely on their own, while they are still detained in government facilities, and separated from family. The Young Center promotes the best interests of unaccompanied immigrant children with due regard to the child&#8217;s wishes, even though there is no best interests standard in U.S. immigration law. Our job is to make sure that these children, all of whom face deportation, have their best interests attended to by immigration judges and enforcement officials. The U.S. has a long tradition of offering refuge for those who fear for their safety, for those who because of their status face serious danger, but there’s a gap in our law when it comes to children. In addition to training and providing volunteer Child Advocates, who stand with the children and represent their interests in immigration proceedings, the Young Center also advocates for system-wide change. We are currently meeting regularly with federal agencies and policy-makers in Washington and the Rio Grande Valley to ensure that the few protections available to these children are not lost as the issue is increasingly politicized.

We envision a New Mexico in which all people äóñ regardless of their race, immigration, or economic status äóñ have equal access to justice, as well as access to education, government resources, and economic opportunities, and are able to engage fully in the civic and economic life of our neighborhoods and community. Access to high-quality immigration services provided by NMILC enables immigrants to obtain legal status that can lead to better jobs, access to credit and bank accounts, reunification with family members, access to healthcare, increased educational opportunities for children and adults, and full participation in the civic life of our neighborhoods and communities. While gaining immigration status brings a certain level of economic and family stability, naturalization creates opportunities for newcomers to fully participate in the civic life of their communities. The New Mexico Immigrant Law Center is committed to providing high-quality legal representation in complex immigration cases, with an emphasis on assisting particularly vulnerable populations, such as children. NMILC is the only nonprofit immigration legal services provider in New Mexico which provides representation to individuals in removal proceedings, including children applying for SIJS. Therefore, for many of the types of cases involving immigrant children, NMILC is the only option.","La misión de NMILC es tener el acceso a la justicia al alcance de los inmigrantes de Nuevo México y de los ciudadanos que aspiran y promover el conocimiento de los derechos legales y el proceso de inmigración .

As soon as eligible children apply for this status, they become immediately eligible for Medicaid and can access needed services. The project provides immigration legal services in close coordination with community health clinics, schools, and social service agencies. This interdisciplinary model aims to meet the medical, mental health and legal needs of the youth and children that participate. Undocumented immigrants who qualify for these humanitarian paths to lawful permanent residence are often unaware of their eligibility for legal status and access to Medicaid that stems from it. The provision of immigration legal assistance that NMILC provides through partnerships with health advocates is a critical and necessary mechanism for reducing the number of uninsured and undocumented children. In addition, to increase access to health care, these services will increase economic security with increased access to employment authorization.","Unaccompanied minors are a marginalized, often traumatized, and a severely under-served population.

We also know that our clients face barriers beyond immigration status and we reach individuals who may not otherwise seek our services.

Family Stability: Providing permanency for children of mixed status immigrant families who are at risk of separation.

Our goal is to raise money to ensure our need to move to a new facility in the neighborhood does not interrupt the over 10 years of health access, community, and basic support our organization has provided to the Fruitvale community. As a grassroots organization dedicated to reducing health disparities, we define health in a way that represents the full spectrum of needs of low-income immigrant families and day laborers. By viewing health as “more than a clinic visit,” we respond to the growing need for preventative wellness services such as nutritious food, access to health coverage, job skills, and other basic needs in our community. Our new facility is a welcoming community space in the heart of the Fruitvale neighborhood, and includes a licensed kitchen space which allows us to serve 100+ nutritious meals per week to day laborers and low-income families, as well as a free medical clinic which offers culturally responsive visits with a doctor or mental health provider. The support of donors at this time is critical to our ability to continue supporting those least visible. Every day we are hearing about the stressors of gentrification and displacement on our community members, most recently we felt them ourselves as staff of a highly needed agency. I would also like to take the time to introduce myself as the new Executive Director of Street Level Health Project. As the son of low-income immigrants, I personally know the reality of living at the intersections of poverty and documentation, so displacement is not new. Regardless of our resiliency, the trauma it imposes is real. Looking back at my own experience as a low-income youth accessing health clinics and public benefits, it always felt like service providers failed to acknowledge the multiple barriers my family faced in accessing continuous health care. That&#8217;s not the case at Street Level and why as someone committed to advancing immigrant rights, I ask you to join us by giving today.","Recently-arrived immigrants, particularly low-wage workers such as day laborers, have an immense need for health and wellness services. We have seen many clinic patients who have felt ill, lethargic, or fainted at work because they were malnourished or were suffering from food-related chronic illnesses like diabetes and hypertension. What we have seen in our clinic is consistent with what larger research shows: low-income Latinos have a high incidence of preventable illnesses correlated with poor nutrition, including high incidence of Type 2 Diabetes and Hypertension. Furthermore, many of the Latino families we serve are undocumented or have mixed-status. Because of their immigration status, many of our clients receive little to no public benefits – despite living far below the poverty level. As a first-generation child, I was privileged that at least I qualified for this benefit even though in a family of four it was still a constant struggle. At Street Level we improve health by building community, offering holistic wellness services, and serving as an entry point to the health care and social service sector. All services are free and offered in a safe and culturally responsive environment.","The budget for our program is much more then we are seeking for from our HIPGive fundraising. The $5,000 contributed through this campaign will offset some of $2,000 in annual food costs. It will also be used toward funding $2,000 of the salary to staff a case manager for drop-in services. Finally the $500 raised will by much needed supplies for our cook to continue to create miracles in our new licensed kitchen. This includes pots, pans, re-usable dishware, knives and other critical supplies.",,"Street Level Health Project is an Oakland-based grassroots organization dedicated to improving the health and wellbeing of underserved urban immigrant communities in the Bay Area.

However we still find obstacles to its implementation and effective access of young women. This situation increases in the provinces where there are cultural, religious and political obstacles for the access to our rights. In addition, gender issues and sexual and reproductive rights are not installed permanently on the political agendas of social and student youth organizations that are not exclusively feminist or sexual diversity. The youth members of social organizations in general do not have sufficient training on existing regulations to ensure sexual and reproductive rights. This reality brings about the absence or presence of organized activities by the youth sector in the area of ​​enforcement of laws through public policies. Also it is a demand and a concern in most of the young people to start working these issues within their organizations installing the issue on their political agenda as to influence politically, from their collective, in the public sphere. The project aims to promote the formation of a group of 20 young women and their leadership as promoters on sexual and reproductive health and rights through workshops with their peers in social organizations and student movement, about gender and sexual and reproductive rights, promoting joint and networking with their peers. It thus aims to influence political agendas of social youth organizations to identify, the transformative power of this age sector, promoting its impact on the political scene by demanding and guaranteing the access to sexual and reproductive health and rights. It is also important to remark that the training of young leaders regarding social organizations will spread knowledge among youngers and promotes the incidence of youth sector in the political sphere.","The project aims to promote the generation of&nbsp;a group of young women tas promoters and leaders in sexual and reproductive rights who are going to be trained to conduct workshops with their peers from social organizations and the student movement, on sexual and reproductive rights, promoting joint and work networks to your requirement.

By providing educational opportunities to women, we are helping to build their leadership as drivers of healthy family and community development. Historically, most hometown associations have been men, but FEDECMI/Casa Michoacan has made a conscious decision to expand the participation and leadership of migrant women. Migrant women are both disporportionately affected by poverty and uniquely positioned to facilitate a healthy integration for families. The lack of identity documents is often cited by FEDECMI women members as a barrier to women&#8217;s participation in the economy and civic life in both the US and Mexico. The first step toward getting a matricular ID, or a passport is a primary school certificate. Migrant women are also disproportionalely likely to have left school in Mexico prior to completion of the primary degreee. FEDECMI offers basic education and tailored instruction, as well as the testing for the award of the primary certificate. With the primary certificate and an ID, women are much more likely to access medical services, the employment market, and to pursue additional education. To complete the program, often requires women to take days off work, travel long distances, and arrange for child care. By providing a scholarships, FEDECMI will both honor that effort, and stimulate further study.","The overall budget of Casa Michoacan/FEDECMI is $213,000. This project will provide up to 20 scholarships of $100 to women who complete the first phase of the basic education program and want to move on. The remaining funds will support an award ceremony, certificates of achievment, and 3+ follow up events for networking and sharing experiences to build a cohort of women leaders.",,"The Federation of Michoacan Clubs in Illinois (FEDECMI )is a non-profit organization, comprised of 34 home-town clubs from the state of Michoacán, Mexico.

The Official National Household Survey states that one in every three women live in the rural areas of El Salvador out of which 45% live in poverty, only 28% go to school and on average reach up to the 4th grade; this combined with less access and control of lands and resources, gender discrimination, and informal employment are the struggles that these women face every day which makes it very difficult for them and their families to access better life opportunities. Through the project “Women Building their Future” women from 15 municipalities of the rural areas of El Salvador will be able to participate in Field Training Schools that FUSA-Libras de Amor implements. Here women will be able to expand their knowledge about different aspects such as: nutrition, entrepreneurship, self- esteem, recognizing their skills, production cycles, and establishment and management of productive projects. It is for this reason that the Field Training Schools represent an opportunity for women to gain and share knowledge on small scale poultry farming, home gardens and other productive initiatives that guarantee food security and income generation for them and their families. We believe that women play a critical role in the transformation of communities and that they are agents of change for El Salvador, by investing in them and providing them with the tools for them to change their lives, their families , their communities and society.","There are thousands of women that live in the rural areas of El Salvador who struggle every day to provide the basic necessities for them and their families. Through “Women weaving their Future” we have the opportunity to provide these women with the tools, resources and knowledge to access better life opportunities for them and their families. Investing in rural women will have a multiplier effect and the power to generate social change that will transcend time because ultimately it is these women who are raising our future generations. We need to invest in them so that their children can be given the opportunity to reach their full potential. With this project we expect to benefit at least 120 women through their participation in the Field Training Schools. Every woman that attends will gain technical knowledge on agricultural productive initiatives which will primarily allow them to improve the food security for them and their families and also increase their income.

Esta situación coloca a las mujeres en una situación de desventaja social y cultural que provoca discriminación, violencia y violación de sus derechos humanos. El proyecto visibilizará las prácticas de desigualdad generadas por décadas en las comunidades indígenas, a partir de ello, podrán construir relaciones de género igualitarias sin vulnerar su cosmovisión, pero con respeto a los derechos humanos, para prevenir la violencia de los hombres hacia las mujeres y las niñas, y las prácticas tradicionales que les son perjudiciales. 3.- Por qué es importante: Culturalmente, se asigna a las mujeres roles al interior de la familia y de la comunidad que las colocan en una situación de vulnerabilidad social, cultural, patrimonial y económica, generando un desequilibrio de poder entre los géneros. Tradicionalmente, los hombres son la autoridad en los hogares indígenas, lo que les da poder de decisión sobre la vida familiar, y especialmente, sobre las mujeres, ejerciendo así violencia psicológica, económica, patrimonial, sexual y física. 4.- Cómo se va a lograr el objetivo: La lógica de intervención propuesta es a partir del modelo teórico-práctico, educativo e interdisciplinario, que permita la reflexión y análisis de los procesos subjetivos y fenómenos sociales, políticos y culturales desde el enfoque de género, derechos humanos e interculturalidad para favorecer su incorporación y puesta en práctica en el ámbito comunitario y familiar de las y los participantes.

In reality, 243 unaccompanied minors sought our services over 2015. In order to meet this need, EBSC hired an additional full-time attorney, part-time attorney, and two dedicated UUM paralegals.

Primary among the procedural challenges for these children are the lack of government-appointed legal representatives and child advocates, as well as the lack of child-sensitive standards for immigration relief.[1] Legal representation has a significant impact on the outcome of immigration proceedings case; one study found that the likelihood of success in non-detained proceedings increased from 13% to 74% with the assistance of counsel. Pro bono or low-cost legal representation thus is essential for UACs to obtain the immigration relief that they so desperately need. Many of these children have suffered traumatic events that adversely affect their psychosocial well-being, including their ability to trust others, and their cognition, including their ability to focus and learn. Moreover, they find themselves in a new country and culture with limited access to advocates who speak their native language. These children thus also require legal services that are trauma-informed; age- and culturally appropriate; and available, where possible, in their mother tongue. For most UACs, this language would be Spanish or, particularly for Guatemalans, an indigenous language such as Mam, Quiche, or Kaqchikel.

There is nothing at all: There is no work, no opportunities, no hope!! &nbsp; Since Colombia is an independent state, the community of La Guajira has been forgotten by the central government. This is how development has not yet landed. Needs in health, education, housing, drinking water, paid employment, quality of life, transportation, food are evident. This project to produce biofuels for aviation from the sea kelp quota would give the economic impulse that the Wayuú Indigenous Reservation community of the Upper and Middle Guajira Colombiana needs to subsist in a dignified way, preserve its culture and develop as a community. The economic contributions will be used for the first step of consolidation of the company: SOCIALIZATION, to take place during the month of February 2017. Achieving the independence and economic viability of the Wayuú community of Upper and Middle Guajira would facilitate the process of inclusion in the economy and leverage the development and sustainability of their culture and customs. &nbsp; This company will be dedicated from the beginning of its activities to: 1.-Generate well-paid employment 2.-Facilitate access to the basic family basket at economic prices 3.-Decent housing: There will be 800 homes built in the next 2 years in the area. 4.-Also in a year will be built the educational complex with kindergarten, primary, secondary and university. 5.- A basic level of care clinic will be built.

Currently, 40% of Puerto Ricans live below the poverty line, and 57% of individuals under the age of 18 are below the poverty line. In terms of the third sector, Puerto Rico has approximately 11,600 active nonprofits, out of which 40% are somehow dependent on local government funds. This is an alarming number, especially considering the fiscal crisis that the Island is facing. It is imperative to create innovative spaces and resources that allow us to work, in the long term, from the base of our communities in order to capitalize and build on existing talent. In addition to supporting non-profit organizations that drive entrepreneurship at the community level, the Puerto Rico Community Foundation has two main projects to achieve this goal: The Community Investment Fund (FIC) provides access to capital for non-profit organizations for economic development and housing rehabilitation projects. The FIC is the first community investment fund in Puerto Rico that is designed exclusively to provide financing to organizations, its mission is to increase financial capital in communities for the generation of jobs, companies and development of assets. The FIC addresses one of the most pressing needs in our community-based organizations: access to capital. Having passed the threshold of this fiscal crisis, it is essential that these organizations have the support they need in order to strengthen our &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; community networks and make sure that our communities’ needs are met. The financing programs offered by FIC are aimed at capitalizing on community lending programs, buying and rehabilitating social housing, providing operational capital and financing projects that generate economic and social performance. To date, FIC has provided funding to: The Fund for Creative Industries in Santurce (FICre) aims to create and promote access to capital by seeking to develop the creative industries sector, initially in Santurce, the urban heart of San Juan. The FICre was established by the Community Foundation of Puerto Rico and the Trade and Export Company, establishing the first Public-Community Alliance on the Island. The importance and recognition of the creative industries in Puerto Rico as an economic development tool for the Island has greatly increased. Recently, the Institute of Statistics of Puerto Rico published a report that indicates that the creative companies generate approximately 18,987 jobs in 742 establishments. The report also indicates that of that total, 87% are small companies with less than 10 employees. The creative industries have become one of the main tools of participatory rehabilitation in the urban centers of Puerto Rico, mainly in Santurce.

Mexico holds the fourth highest cesarean rate in the world. Women are often victims of obstetric violence and unnecessary interventions. The Midwives model of care has been demonstrated and recommended by the WHO as the best model of care for women during their sexual and reproductive lives. Mexico sustains a 46% cesarean rate, reaching 79% in private hospitals. The WHO recommends the cesarean rate not exceed 15%. Professional midwives have proven to sustain low rates of interventions and cesarean with high rates of maternal satisfaction and bonding between mothers and babies. Luna Maya was established in Chiapas in 2004 in order to humanize health services through the midwives model of care. Through two birth centers in Chiapas and Mexico City, Luna Maya provides services at sliding scale to over 2500 families per year. Luna Maya sustains a global cesarean rate of 9% and 95% exclusive breastfeeding rate at 6 weeks postparto. In over 11 years of service provision we have never had a maternal death. Each year, two midwives are trained through the apprenticeship model following requirements established by the North American Registry of Midwives. Luna Maya does not receive funding for training midwives, nor do we charge our students for the training. Our crowdfunding campaign will help cover the costs of training four midwives: 3 in Mexico City and 1 in Chiapas. Midwives trained in Luna Maya work at the Luna Maya birth centers or open their own in villages and cities in Mexico offering quality health services to Mexican women. Since we opened we have trained nine midwives, one of whom is currently the director of the Chiapas birth center, and another is co-director in the Mexico City birth center. The lack of economic support and financial realities of women in Mexico has lead to four women having to leave the training program in search of jobs. Luna Maya is the only organization in Mexico that trains midwives under a personalized apprenticeship model. Our proven model trains midwives to practice and be leaders in the movement to increase access to midwifery in Mexico. We need your support to ensure our students can finish the training program and go on to open more birth centers.","Mexico holds unacceptable cesarean section rates. In the public sector almost half (46%) of babies are born my cesarean. In the private sector e cesrean rates reach 79%. Rates of obstetric violence are very high and women are often left confused and traumatized after their births. Although it is almost impossible to measure the rates of obstetric violence, several sexual and reproductive rights agencies have focused reports and advocacy efforts on reducing obstetric violence in Mexican hospitals. In the public system, women are forced to labor alone, on their backs, with no pain management or support. Those who birth vaginally are taken to delivery rooms where bright lights and shouts to “push quickly before the baby suffocates&#8221;. Most women are given episiotomies, are not given their baby after birth and their uterus´ are wiped down with sterile gauze after the placenta is delivered. Women are increasingly terrified of hospital care and increasingly social networks speaks of options to access “humanized birth” . The midwives model of care has been proven to decrease intervention rates, improve satisfaction and outcomes. At Luna Maya, the global cesarean rate is 9%. Women receive care from the same group of midwives throughout their entire pregnancy, receive acupuncture, childbirth education and then return for the postpartum motherhood and fatherhood groups. Couples receive continuous support during labor and home visits during the first week postpartum. In over 11 years of care, we have attended over 500 births, with kind, state of the art, quality care. As demand of quality obstetrical services increases, women have very few options to become midwives. Mexico City and Chiapas have no midwifery schools. Obstetric nursing programs in Mexico city and the two nationally recognized midwifery schools train women in the same medicalized model. Luna Maya is the only existing formalized midwifery education program that trains midwives based on the International Confederation of Midwives competencies and North American Registry of Midwives requirements. Over the past eleven years we have developed a midwifery training program that successfully trains midwives. Graduated midwives go on to open birth centers, provide midwifery services for Mexican women or work with Luna Maya and are leaders in their communities and in the national midwifery movement. How we are born has severe effects on our short, medium and long term health. Women who are abused during pregnancy and birth have much higher risk for depression and lower rates of breast feeding. Unnecessary interventions have profound implications on the emotional development of babies and their capacity to bond. Cesarean section has now been proven to triple asthma, obesity and diabetes rates in children and double the rates of auto-immune disorders, in women cesarean is linked to three times higher maternal mortality, future fertility problems and placental malformations. Study after study has shown that the best way to avoid an unnecessary cesarean or interventions is to receive care by a midwife. Training midwives is an immediate and profound solution to the maternal health crisis in Mexico. Through this project we will train four new midwives in less than two years who will be able to open a third birth center and provide services to many more families.","Support midwifery salaries $1,500 Copies and office supplies $600 Books and midwifery education materials and supplies $400 Travel expenses $600 Clinical supplies $400 Clinical equipment $600 Utilities $300 Reburbishment and birth center maintenance $600 Total $5000 &nbsp; Total organizational budget 2016: $85,000",,"Luna Maya was established in Chiapas in 2004 to humanize health services through the midwives model of care.

Luna Maya is recognized as a leader in enabling space within the birth centers where families can engage in community support. Throughout the week classes and workshops are taught for women and families, including doula training once a year and continued education classes for midwives and health providers.

They are vulnerable to violence when immigrating, while at work, and out in the community because of their immigration status and the fear of retaliation for reporting crimes and exploitation that being undocumented brings. However, for those who do suffer violence and abuse, a U-VISA brings much-needed security in one&#8217;s immigration status, helps victims report abuses and help police pursue perpetrators, and ultimately helps victims heal and rebuild their lives.

However, our ultimate goal goes beyond finding a source of decent work and a fair wage for these women: we aim to raise funds to support the Women’s Network of San Marcos, which since 2005, has been working toward the empowerment of women and the fulfillment of their rights, as well as becoming self-sufficient and lifting the voices of women everywhere. We are determined to meet our goal: now we only need an initial investment in order to buy machinery, provide a space for production/ safe house for victims of domestic violence, and to pay every production worker a living wage. If you help support us in this beginning process, by December 2016 we will be able to market our first series of products. The revenue we receive from this first batch of production will serve to self-finance the Women’s Network, continue creating political empowerment for the members, and also the continuation of production for export. We are determined to achieve our goal: to weave our own autonomy. The Women’s Network of San Marcos The Women’s Network, above all, is the loom of our autonomy. Before threading the needle with us, you present it. This is a women’s organization located in Guatemala, specifically the Department of San Marcos on the Western side of the country. Since 2005, with very limited resources, we have worked to empower women in the knowledge and demand of their rights; increase their political participation in the decision-making processes; fight against gender violence; accompany legal cases of such violence; provide them with professional psychological support, and ultimately, to fight for the independence of women. Objetive of Strengthen the tread: to weave our autonomy The Women’s Network has previously been supported by international projects, but since December 2015, has been left without funds to continue developing our organization. Budget cuts in funding for international cooperation has led to the abandonment of many NGOs in Guatemala. For some time now, through all the components that make up the Women’s Network, we have been realizing the necessity of finding our own self-sustainability, ie., find an activity that will generate the necessary income to support our work and, why not, grow our goals. It was in this context that the idea of Strengthen the Thread was born. Therefore, Strengthen the Thread will become the production branch of the Women’s Network and will initially consist of the most vulnerable group of women, those who have suffered from gender violence in any of its forms (physical, sexual, psychological, economic, etc.). If the project is a success and becomes self-sustainable, we will begin to incorporate other profiles of women who would earn a living wage as well. Watch this video to learn more about our project. Check out our website for more information. Strengthen the Thread is also available on Facebook and Twitter. Products of Strengthen the Thread As an organization, we desire to reclaim our culture, our identity, and our ancestral practices of indigenous peoples, which are being lost because of the profound racism that prevails in Guatemala, the ferocious rise of capitalism, and consumption practices that exponentially increases poverty in the communities of our women. In the Department of San Marcos, we tell stories of our ancestral art, which remains of great worth to us. We have always valued our unique and precious traditional fabrics made with standing weaving looms. This art form is something we have to learn and improve, but with strength and commitment to this weaving through the Women’s Network, we will begin with clear determination to make and sell our traditional fabrics that allow us to strengthen our independence. Some of our products are modern adaptations of traditional designs, however the techniques we use are of our ancestors and the same they have always used to make the traditional dress of Mayans. The means of production for all of our products is fair, sustainable, and works toward solidarity. Watch this video to learn more about the production process of our crafts and traditional fabrics.","Guatemala has been characterized as an absent State—or often an accomplice—of vast inequalities and human right’s violations that occur within the country. Regarding violence against women specifically, in Guatemala one in two women have suffered some form of gender violence, and in the Department of San Marcos alone, more than 268,000 women have become victims of this type of aggression. However, out of this high number of attacks, only 253 complaints have been convicted. The situation is alarming, and we must respond loudly. We cannot stop our advocacy actions that demand to change this situation. So we weave, united and committed, our autonomy. Weaving is not our purpose, it is our tool to gain our rights. To date, more than 90% of the women that participate in the Women’s Network live in rural areas and suffer from poverty or extreme poverty. Approximately 50% are illiterate, and only 45% have completed a primary education. The Women’s Network is also a tool to reach our potential within our possibilities, to learn that we can live with dignity as long as our rights are respected, and to correct the grievances we carry from a history of exclusion","La Red de Mujeres no dispone de financiamiento actualmente, por ello nos urge iniciar la campaña de Refuerza el hilo.

The UWC has organized over 60 workplace committees and helped recuperate close to $1 million dollars in stolen wages and back pay—putting hard earned money back in the pockets of working families and into our local economies. Highlights of upcoming initiatives: In Santa Fe, members are working to strengthen the city and county&#8217;s sanctuary policies to protect our families not only from deportation but also from wage theft, discrimination, and retaliation in the workplace. In Gallup, members founded the McKinley Worker Justice Coalition to improve conditions for Latino and Native American workers and to strengthen wage and worker’s rights enforcement resources in rural communities. In southeastern New Mexico, members are launching a dairy worker campaign to counter wage theft and organize for better health and safety conditions in this dangerous industry.

But, the lack of education have generated barriers to find a suitable job for the people of Ciudad Delgado. With the intention to make a change in the future of one of the most violent cities in El Salvador, the Skills Training Center of San Francisco de Asis, coordinated by Ana Celia Leiva, provides job skills training courses aimed at improving and expanding job opportunities to people with limited resources in Ciudad Delgado. The program, in addition to providing the theoretical and practical tools to develop specific skills to increase employability and keep them out of violence in Ciudad Delgado, also improve their lives by providing coaching on personal and life values that will reflect on a higher job performance and stronger commitment at the workplace. The center trains more than 160 students between 8 and 60 years old. The courses available range from Mechanics, Cosmetology, Computing, Home Repair, Carpenter, Bakery, Sales Rep, among others. Proposal The current venue site where workshops are held lacks proper infrastructure conditions to perform the trainings. The roof is seriously damaged suffering water leakage during the entire raining season and allowing the sunlight heat impact the entire area all day. The proposal includes the construction of a new site measuring 6 mts wide x 5 mts long y 3 mts high suitable to conduct classes all year long.

Where does matter go in a chemical change? Our students learned the answers to these questions (and more!) this year in science class. With hands-on labs, they discovered new ways to understand science principles and the world around them. According to the White House Initiative on Educational Excellence for Hispanics, Hispanic students are not sufficiently exposed to STEM subjects before college, which causes them to be ill-prepared for the millions of available STEM jobs available (nearly 6 million in 2013 alone). You can ensure our students are fully equipped for their science labs, and together we can close the gap in both achievement and opportunity. Science answers questions. Science broadens horizons.

Only about half of low-income and Latino male students meet basic grade level standards for math and reading. These students experience a similarly dismal likelihood of graduating from high school—making some of the most stable careers (STEM jobs) inaccessible to these students. The Opportunity: San Miguel School provides low-income and at-risk middle school students in the DC metro area with an education that changes the lives—not only the lives of its students, but also their families. Our model is a proven success: 100% of students test on grade level in reading and math by 8th grade graduation; 100% of 8th graders are accepted in the area’s top college-preparatory high school programs. Their preparation at San Miguel pays off with a 100% high school graduation rate in a city where only 53% of those living in poverty will graduate. Solution: With your help, we can equip our students with the skills necessary to secure these science-based jobs and instill the confidence needed for them to pursue these stable, well-paying careers. In order to do that successfully, it is critical have access to these laboratory skills and these concepts before they reach high school—not only for the practical experience and exposure to possibilities, but also to spark their enthusiasm in time to plan their high school courses and seek out further STEM opportunities. &nbsp;","Each electronic balance is $164.75 plus 15% shipping = $189.46.

Though the state will not receive much attention in the presidential election, critical House of Representatives and State Senate elections will be heavily contested and offer tremendous opportunities to educate community members and influence public discussion on priorities for working-class communities of color, immigrants, and LGBTQ residents. Building on the tremendous success of its recent voter engagement work, Make the Road New York will undertake significant voter registration and GOTV work in 2016—with a particular focus on Long Island, where in 2016 we expect to submit 3,000 completed voter registration forms and conduct three full door-to-door issue identification and Get Out the Vote passes that reach out to 20,000 low-propensity voters. Our electoral work will center on continuing to make the electorate more closely reflect Long Island’s rapidly-changing demographics and increasing the vote share of working-class immigrant, Latino, and African-American voters. By doing so, we will demonstrate the clear impact of an engaged electorate in these communities. We will continue to ensure that the needs and rights of these communities are increasingly central to political decision-making on Long Island, while using electoral organizing to bolster the base-building community organizing work we conduct on an ongoing basis. Meanwhile, we will also hold events during the run-up to the election to elevate critical issues at stake in the campaign and educate voters. Overall, we expect our voter education and mobilization program on Long Island to have a substantial impact on both the composition of the electorate and the issue environment in which we work. Combined with our ongoing organizing work, our electoral work will ensure that climate justice, our two core immigration priorities—immigration reform and the New York DREAM Act—the fight for police accountability, and the fight for economic justice come to the fore of political debate.","New York stands at a crossroads. On the one hand, it has long been considered a progressive bastion, with progressive elected officials and progressive victories on critical issues (e.g., marriage equality) that have resonated beyond the state’s borders. It has also been the site of deep base-building work and large-scale mobilization on issues of economic, racial, immigrant, climate, and LGBTQ justice that have reverberated nationally and won innovative and transformative policies like the New York State Wage Theft Prevention Act, the country’s largest municipal identification program (IDNYC), Paid Sick Days in New York City, curtailing bias-based policing, and many more. On the other hand, in recent years New York State has not lived up to it progressive promise. Primarily because of the opposition of suburban and rural legislators, state government has proved incapable of passing most major progressive legislation, including climate justice legislation (which passed the Assembly but not the Senate), the New York DREAM Act to ensure tuition equity for undocumented students, substantial criminal justice reform, meaningful state-level campaign finance reform, and more. On many of these issues, we have seen other states and localities pass more affirmative policies. We must work to ensure that New York fulfills its progressive potential and follows suit, which, as we saw with marriage equality in our state, will have national reverberations. Moreover, in many of these same contested areas, congressional representatives from New York have blocked progress in the House of Representatives on critical issues like comprehensive immigration reform, raising the federal minimum wage, campaign finance reform and climate justice. The 2016 elections will provide a tremendous opportunity for working-class, immigrant, African-American, and LGBTQ New Yorkers to elevate their critical federal and statewide issue priorities and ensure that they are at the front of voters’ and candidates’ minds.","Our entire budget for this effort is $300,000.

It’s a troubling fact that Latinos earn lower grades on average than their white peers and are much more likely to drop out of high school (Stanford University). In 2012-13, 14% of Chapel Hill- Carrboro Public Schools students were Latino. However, In 2008-09, 80% of US Latino fourth graders were not reading proficiently, compared to 68% of all fourth graders. And only 5% of the Latino students of the Chapel Hill-Carrboro Public Schools was enrolled in gifted program. In North Carolina, almost half of all Latino children under the age of 5 live in poverty, and Latino children are more than twice as likely to live in poverty as white children – 41% compared to 14.4%, respectively (US Census Bureau, 2014). Seventy-seven percent of Latino children in North Carolina live in immigrant families (Action for Children NC, 2010), which presents language and cultural barriers for these families. In North Carolina, 69.4% of foreign-born Spanish speakers older than age 5 have Limited English Proficiency (LEP). Additionally, a figure higher than any other immigrant group, 31% of NC Spanish-speaking households are linguistically isolated. Chapel Hill- Carrboro Latino families are in need of additional support to ensure their children’s academic success due to economic insecurity, language and cultural barriers, low education levels, lack of health insurance, lack of knowledge and familiarity with existing services, fear and distrust of official institutions and lack of culturally and linguistically appropriate programs for communities of color. The tutoring program of El Centro Hispano with Latino children , a simple and powerful intervention has reduced the achievement gap significantly among the kids K to 5 grade that have participated in the program during the last years. 85% of the participants will pass their grade level or improve their performance in reading and/or math based on report cards collected after each term. 100% of participants will have 0% school dropout.

Being the largest of the seven species that exist in the world, it can reach 7.5 feet in length and weigh more than 1,500 lbs.

Contributing to reduce deaths of women from cervical and breast cancer in Nicaragua.,"Our objective is: Give gynecological, psychological and legal attention to 2,000 rural women at risk of cervical cancer and in situations of gender-based violence, in 20 communities of Villa El Carmen Municipality, Nicaragua. Violence against women in rural communities of Villa El Carmen, Nicaragua, is expressed in many ways and especially affects their reproductive health. For most women, their partners control, dominate, and stop them from attending their gynecological checkups. Because of social constructs of gender, there isn&#8217;t a habit of self-care for women in their reproductive health. They only address this health when it is too late and the stage of diseases such as breast or cervical cancer is advanced. The poverty of women increases their health deteriorating because they lack financial resources to pay for quality medical care. According to the Villa el Carmen health center, in 2015 there were 3,000 PAPs among an approximate number of women of reproductive age (13,000 of 20,400 Total of female population), which means 23% looked for the proper gynecological attention and 77% did not seek out this attention. This puts them at risk for cancer because they do not know they have it. There is always surprising news that a woman has died of cervical or breast cancer because it is often undetected. There is distrust among women towards staff in unethical health centers where positive test results are not confidential and people in their community find out. Women&#8217;s health is precarious. Many women who look for attention in gynecological health are referred to the health clinic in the center of the municipality and have to travel in the early morning to take anumber and wait to be seen. Many women return without revision because the clinic reached its limit of patents. Doctors have a established limit of patients they can see in one day. Those that are able to have a PAP get their results after much time and some are even lost. Women attended in this clinic that require special gynecological and breast exams a referred to hospitals but this can be a 6 or 8 month wait because the hospitals too are saturated. This project is relevant, important and urgent to do community journey Mobile Clinic to give immediate response to 2,000 women in preventing cancer, addressing health on time and reducing children orphans. This is a pilot project will give guidelines for the management, installation and operation of comprehensive clinic for women with social character. The objective of this project is achieved through: 2 Community Journies with a mobile clinic, the first for 40 days in 20 rural communities (2 days per community) providing gynecological, psychological care and legal advice to women at risk of cervical cancer and gender-based violence. The second journey is for 20 days to deliver results of gynecological examinations and follow-up cases of emotional recovery and legal services to women in situations of violence. The mobile clinic will be through coordination and partnership with Women&#8217;s Center Ixchen with whom the coordinator of the organization maintains close coordination for having volunteered 20 years ago in the town of Villa El Carmen. In this time period they detected and attended many cases cervical cancer. Ixchen would provide care and organization counseling, legal counseling and community education work for 60 health promoters. We will impact directly on the lives of 2,000 rural women and their families, because many of the 2,000 women will have their first chance to get a checkup and gynecological and breast exams. This can save women&#8217;s lives at risk or carrying cervix cancer, give the opportunity to receive information from established practices of self-care, receive counseling or family planning services, break the cycle of violence, help women improve their mental health, have greater confidence for checkups, give guidance and advice on abuse and legal management to demand alimony.","“Enjoy of good health let us to live a happy and productive life” With your help of this project you will be contributing to reduce deaths of women from cervical and breast cancer, less poverty in families, fewer children orphans, fewer doctors cats and less violence on women and the family.

Knowing about domestic violence helps people examine patterns in their own life to identify the possibility that they might be in a violent relationship. If we target this problem in teenagers, we can help promote healthy relationships and stop the problem in its early stages. Through education, people learn the difference between what they see as “normal” and what is actually safe and healthy. Many victims of domestic violence grew up in a violent household. Children learn how to be in a relationship through their parent’s relationship. If their parents are constantly fighting, they may see that as “normal” and will implement that in their own personal relationships. Due to the Latino community’s “Machista” beliefs, men in Latino communities are taught that they have to be tough in order to portray their masculinity. As a result, the Latino community suffers from many cases of domestic violence. Our programs are specifically designed to help women in violent relationships by providing them with opportunities to educate themselves about domestic violence and the resources that are available to them as victims. In the future, we hope to have a Latino community in New Mexico that does not tolerate domestic violence and becomes a role model for communities all over the nation.","The goal of our project is to raise awareness about domestic violence in New Mexico, and ultimately end it.

This is particularly true for Spanish-speaking immigrants who face additional barriers and fears including potential deportation and separation from their children, a lack of empathy and understanding due to language barriers, and generally being unaware of their rights and opportunities as survivors.

Inside the bustling, cosmopolitan city of Buenos Aires, Argentina, there is another “hidden” city, a shantytown or “villa” where people live without roads, sewage systems, garbage removal, and policing. People build their houses out of whatever they can find – concrete blocks and wood, as well as tin and cardboard &#8211; and struggle to make some kind of living, working under the table, with no job security or protections. In 2000, a photographer who had been hired to document life inside the “Ciudad Oculta” (hidden city) – also called Villa 15 – crossed paths with a group of children who lived in the shantytown. &nbsp;They started to follow him everywhere, and asked him to teach them what he was doing. &nbsp;So was born Fundacion ph15 (http://www.ph15.org.ar/en/), a nonprofit photography program, which empowers villa children and helps them develop and hone their voices, through the medium of photography. Over the past 16 years, more than 2,500 children (and 500 adults) have passed through ph15’s programs, which now take place in many more shantytowns around the city of Buenos Aires, and in similar areas throughout Argentina, as well as in Venezuela. The children’s works have been exhibited, lauded, and purchased worldwide including in: Buenos Aires, Madrid, Sao Paolo, North Dakota, Washington DC, Rio De Janeiro, London, Germany, New York City, and beyond. Ph15 participants and graduates have been able to travel throughout Argentina and to Washington DC to discuss and demonstrate their work. And some have secured work professionally as photographers. Ph15&#8217;s Work Philosophy Ph15 aims to help young people experience a sense of belonging, including a feeling of solidarity with their peers and teachers. &nbsp;In order to do this, ph15 creates an atmosphere in which differences are respected, and in which young people learn to work together through honest and transparent communication, and with respectful dialogue and feedback. &nbsp;The organization aims to help young people develop a sense of responsibility, a practice of striving to better oneself and one&#8217;s work, and the enjoyment of participation both in the arts and in working as a group.

We work every day to provide and integral Nutritional Plan that includes special formulas and supplements alongside the daily meals, all designed to fight malnourishment.

Your contribution is very important to us; remember that it is in giving that we receive! #GivingTuesday. Why is it important? All children that live at Hogar Padre Vito Guarato suffer from either mental or physical disabilities; as a result of their health conditions, they can also develop other diseases and ailments, which can in turn cause a severe nourishment issues. To prevent this, children at the home need a specialized diet that is supported by formulas and supplements, so they can maintain the correct amount of nutrients, vitamins and calories that contribute to their ideal weight. If these conditions are left uncared for, it can risk the lives of our children. Impact: Edgar arrived at Hogar Padre Vito Guarato when he was only 9 years old, with severe health issues caused by his ailments: cerebral palsy, intellectual disability and gastroesophageal reflux.

Support 1,168 children and youth of Residencial Libertad, in the municipality of Tonacatepeque, so they continue learning English as a second language.","The problem The life of Salvadoran children and youth is marked by poverty, violence and a sense of despair. These problems limit their access to opportunities, it takes away the happiness of everyday life, the opportunity to have a good education and in general it limits their quality of life and reaching their full potential as adults. For a country like El Salvador, where 56.2 % of the population is between 0 and 29 years (UNICEF Report on the Situation of Children and Youth in El Salvador) the importance of investing in children and youth is key, if not problems such as poverty, violence and migration arise. The public school system in El Salvador does not have a strong English program but the job market requires it as a labor skill each day more and more, this program would provide these students with an upper hand when entering the work force as well as access to higher salaries. We believe that by providing children and youth with tools that will allow them access better life opportunities we can aid in closing the gaps that hinder the development of the nation. The Residencial Libertad School is a public school in the community of Residencial Libertad located in the municipality of Tonacatepeque, an area characterized for its high violence. Children and youth living in high risk communities such as this one generally have low self-esteem, and lack a sense of empowerment. In addition, they do not have a clear vision of their future nor have they set ambitious goals for themselves, feeling that their greatest achievement will be completing high school and very few aspire to attend college, acquire technical knowledge or attain well-paid jobs. Living in an environment of violence and precariousness makes the possibility of changing and being different more of a challenge for thousands of children and youth. This type of environment unties a series of misjudgment, tags and rejection that go hand in hand with limited opportunities and loss of hope. Salvadoran children and youth have gone from being seen as the future, to a dangerous and hopeless generation. How will my project make a difference? In Proyecto País of FUSAL we believe that investing in vulnerable and at risk youth represents the opportunity to start breaking the cycle of poverty and violence that surrounds them and their families. One way to do this is by providing the tools they need to expand their education and employment opportunities. Learning a second language will allow them to focus their time and energy in a productive activity that will expand their educational opportunities, improve their employment possibilities, and will fill them and their families with pride and better self-esteem. In 2015 we began a pilot program in Residencial Libertad that consisted on implementing a strong English program from preschool to high school where students receive 5 hours of English classes per week. The methodology being implemented is engaging, participating and dynamic in order to develop the necessary skills to speak the language. By using visual, communicative and auditory methods we have achieved good results and children and youth now have a basic knowledge of the language. It is expected that students from preschool and elementary have an overall average of 80% in the classroom and students from middle and high school achieve a grade of 70%. The results: children are exited, teachers are motivated, and the community is nurturing their sense of pride. Our goal The challenge of providing tools and opportunities for Salvadoran youth inspired us to launch the fundraising campaign &#8220;No labels, more opportunities&#8221;, with the purpose of providing 1,168 students from the Residencial Libertad School, in the municipality of Tonacatepeque, the textbooks and workbooks they need to continue learning English. What will the funds raised be used in? 200 English textbooks for different ages will be purchased. These books will be kept as school property and they will be used for years to come in the years ahead. Each one of the 1,168 students will receive their own workbook. Our organization The Salvadoran Foundation for Health and Human Development (FUSAL) is a private, non-profit organization that connects committed businessmen who care for human development and are in solidarity with the less favored sectors of society, helping them through health, nutrition and violence prevention. For more than 30 years, we have designed and put into practice successful intervention models that have been efficient, sustainable and with high impact. Our three main social programs are: Chance, Libras de Amor and Proyecto País. Chance Program gives the opportunity to have a full life through the distribution of medicines, educational material, footwear, clothing, agricultural inputs, food, and wheelchairs, among others. Libras de Amor is present in 18 municipalities in the rural areas of our country serving over 160,000 people. Its objective is to contribute to overcoming poverty by reducing indicators of infant malnutrition and anemia, specially in children under 5 years old and pregnant women. FUSAL is also committed to the full development of young people and creating communities that are in harmony. Taking this into account, Proyecto País works with children and young people from five municipalities that have been affected by violence, using their free time in productive activities and giving them the necessary tools they need to improve their access to education and work opportunities in the future. Residencial Libertad is part of Proyecto País and sets the example of a successful social violence prevention model. This housing complex started 15 years ago with the objective of giving families in vulnerable conditions an adequate and decent housing, access to health through a clinic; quality education by having its own educational center and recreational spaces.

So far in 2016, there has been a 24.8% spike in Citizenship applications compared to the same time last year. With Election Day around the corner and with the end of 2016 just a few months away, New Mexico Immigrant Law Center is ready to make that number spike even higher! Citizenship has many benefits: it provides individuals safety from deportation, increased ability to travel, the ability to petition for visas for more family members, increased access to public benefits, and, perhaps most notably, the right to vote in federal elections. New Mexico Immigrant Law Center is focused on making the citizenship process as accessible as possible to the more than 60,000 immigrants estimated to eligible in the state. We will host 14 workshops from September until mid-December to assist applicants to prepare their applications pro se, organize a citizenship fair with other nonprofit organizations to bring attention to the benefits of citizenship and assist even more applicants, and continue to provide legal representation for those individuals who would benefit from having an attorney throughout the application process. Our citizenship services include: Weekly Walk-In Pro Se Workshop: &nbsp;Held at a local Latino adult education organization, this is one of the most popular services NMILC provides. NMILC staff guide applicants through their forms, then an attorney approves each application before it is sent to immigration. Legal Fairs: Our first citizenship fair is scheduled for this fall! We have been able to serve up to 40 clients in one day at legal fairs&#8211; the same amount we can serve in a month at the weekly workshops. Direct Representation: Citizenship applicants whose cases are more &ldquo;complex&rdquo; may be represented by an NMILC attorney. Our staff works hard to provide representation for many applicants, especially those in a particularly vulnerable situation.","Election day is high stakes. Our next president and elected officials will be deciding critical issues such as immigration reform. Unfortunately, since only U.S. citizens can vote in federal elections, most immigrants do not have the opportunity to vote this election. Over 19,800 immigrants in Bernalillo County alone are eligible for citizenship. If even a fraction of those eligible immigrants were to naturalize, it could impact our local elections.

This is done through a series of classes as part of the program designed for this purpose. In addition, there is another program which helps children live a more intelligent sexuality. An important personality trait is a healthy sexuality that should be reflected in one’s values and everyday behavior. The “Protege tu Corazón” program studies sexuality in great depth and presents it from different perspectives in a dynamic and participative manner so that all students can easily understand these concepts. The program offers various arguments supported by facts that allow students to freely make better choices with a proper thought process. The Purpose of the Project To allow 228 children from Fe y Alegría School in the community of the Lake of Coatepeque to receive the “Protege tu Corazón” program. The purpose is to provide sexuality-based education in character building. Why is it important? We believe that children are capable of valuing and protecting their heart so that they know how to manage their emotions through adolescence and into adulthood. In the future, they will be able to form strong marriages and have united families that are built on a solid value based foundation. This is just the beginning since the program will reach only 228 students for the moment. Our hope is that they impact their families and community so that we can have a better society. Where will the Funds go? The total cost of the program is $2,800.

CEP introduces students to local artists, performers and educators who guide students in artistic self exploration. CEP features a Homework Club with one-on-one tutoring for all 50 participants. Demonstrated success: of 22 report cards collected last year, 5 demonstrate excellent academic and behavior across the board, another 8 demonstrated significant improvement or adequate behavioral development. Students demonstrated improvement in visual arts, music and computer science. Our Youth Artist Program (YAP) is a two-year artistic-skill development and college-access program for up to 15 high-school students. It provides academic tutoring, guidance on career choices, and connections to colleges. Students participate in college-access activities, such as visits to colleges and job fairs. Students produce, over a two-year period, a solid portfolio of artwork that can be used for admission into arts colleges and universities. Based on an 11-year average, 84% of YAP students graduated high school, and 83% of those students went directly to college, showing a steady rise of graduation and college-attendance rates during this time. Your support wil allow us to not only continue this vital programming, but also expand it- this September, we will be moving to brand-new facilities that are much larger than our current buildings, allowing us to effectively double the number of children and youth we reach through these programs.","Taller fosters the potential of its community in Northeast Philadelphia (area codes: 19133, 19140, 19122, 19124, and 19125, some of the poorest in the City) and its members through the transformative impact of arts and cultural education. Focusing on the Latino population, we work to promote and teach Latino/Puerto Rican arts and culture. Since Taller’s beginnings, the organization has been committed to passing along traditional Latino culture and providing positive artistic outlets for the next generation. Our Education Programs allow us to reaffirm this commitment and expand upon our over four decades of work in this field. We will create a presence for the scholarly pursuit of Puerto Rican and Latino arts and culture by teaching young people about their and others’ Latino backgrounds and encouraging exploration, learning, art creation and participation. Taller aims to strengthen its community and utilize the positive and transformative effects of art in helping children and youth in ways that expand career opportunities, improve educational abilities, and strengthen a sense of self and belonging contributing to advance the potential of its community in Northeast Philadelphia. Arts programming is especially important for low-income students, as incorporating arts and cultural education into their regular curriculum helps their academic performance level rise to that of average higher-income students (President’s Committee on the Arts and Humanities, 2011).

Latinx kids experience high rates of obesity and diabetes that lead to shorter lifespans. Nurturing Latinx culture, stories, community power is the answer and the first step in confronting these injustices. While Boulderites enjoy healthy food, the injustice of sugary drinks keeps Latinx behind. Latinx drink more, suffer from more diabetes, and die earlier. This is no accident.&nbsp;It is the result of decades of industry equating sugar with Latinx family love, intentional efforts to keep soda cheap and everywhere, systematic discrimination in affordability and access to healthy foods, the stress of racism and a broken immigration system, and daily barriers to education, transportation, housing, and healthcare. All these barriers pile up into an unscalable wall that splits Boulder in two: one Boulder with soaring health and wealth, and one Boulder that&#8217;s struggling to keep its head above water.

Prospera does not think this is a choice low-income Latina moms should have to make. You can help provide Latina Moms with access to childcare while they participate in Prospera II: a comprehensive program that brings cohorts of Latina entrepreneurs from cooperative business idea to launch, through technical assistance, training, and coaching. Most of our program participants are mothers, many of whom are the heads-of-household, who often rely on family or friends for childcare. This is not always a viable option. Without reliable childcare many of the leaders in our program would have to miss sessions or drop out of the program completely. By lowering the barriers for these entrepreneurial moms, together we can support their leadership development as they work to become worker-owners of their very own cooperatives. These businesses will benefit hundreds of women, as well as their families and their communities at large. By building the capacity of Latina immigrant women, we help them move their families out of poverty, create wealth in their communities, and ultimately become ambassadors for co-op development in marginalized communities.","Prospera believes that we need services and programs that meet the needs of marginalized communities and bring these communities&rsquo; unique strengths to the forefront of this new economic justice movement, in order to ensure that our new economy does not replicate the flaws of the old economy. Latina immigrant women face unique challenges. As they struggle to make ends meet and raise their children (sometimes on their own), they find that their job prospects are often limited to low-wage work with employers who provide no benefits, offer little or no protection from abuses, and provide few opportunities for growth. Some key facts, provided by the Center for American Progress, detail the economic reality of Latinas in the U.S.: More than 30% of Latina women work in the service sector, compared with only 20% of white women, and service workers are almost 20 percent less likely to have either paid sick leave or retirement benefits. In Latina families, about 4 in 10 working wives were the primary breadwinners. Latina women make 55 cents to the dollar when compared to white, non-Hispanic males, while white women make 78.1 cents to the same dollar. The median household wealth of single Latina women is $120, while single white women&rsquo;s median household wealth was $41,500. Latina women with children have zero median wealth. Which is why Prospera supports training and co-op businesses that work for mothers. Our trainings are held in the evenings to accommodate our participants&rsquo; schedules, and we believe providing childcare is vital to continue eliminating the barriers for working mothers.","Childcare&nbsp;budget for Prospera II &nbsp; Modules 1 18 hours of instruction X $20 per hour = $360 Module 2 18 hours of instruction X $20 per hour = $360 Module 3 12 hours of instruction X $20 per hour = $240 Module 4 12 hours of instruction X $20 per hour = $240 Cost for one Prospera II program: $1,200 &nbsp; Total cost to provide&nbsp;childcare&nbsp;for two Prospera II programs = $2,400 &nbsp; *All additional funds will be used to provide Childcare as needed for Prospera programs and/or the addition of more children*",,"Prospera partners with low-income Latina women so they can achieve economic prosperity through cooperative business ownership.

The goals are to increase Latino farmworkers’ access to information about their rights, as well as to support young people to get jobs in the farmworker movement. &nbsp; Through an orientation and two retreats, SAF will train interns on farmworker issues, rights and protections, and effective outreach. The trainings will also include problem solving and career planning, as the interns reflect on what they are learning during the program and think about potential careers in professions serving farmworkers. In addition to intensive training and mentorship by advocates in the field, interns will receive a stipend, housing, and a scholarship to continue their education. Receiving a stipend and educational award is key to the participation of farmworker students in the program. &nbsp; In partnership with farm labor, health, education and legal services organizations, SAF interns will conduct outreach farmworkers to: Present “know your rights” trainings, Conduct participatory workshops and focus groups on occupational safety and health issues, Mentor migrant and out of school youth, Provide transportation and interpretation, Coordinate documentary projects and popular theater exercises. &nbsp; Farmworkers are receptive to SAF interns, as the majority of interns are from farmworker families themselves and all are fully bilingual (Spanish/English). Due to the need for temporary staff members to work on a seasonal basis, it is unlikely that the partnering organizations would be able to expand their capacity to meet the needs of migrant farmworkers without SAF interns. &nbsp; As a result of Into the Fields, the interns will be better prepared to pursue careers in Latino advocacy, immigrant rights, labor organizing, legal services, rural health, and migrant education. They will gain on-the-job experience with farmworkers and establish connections with seasoned activists. Since 1992, SAF has trained over 700 interns, and, according to SAF’s most recent survey of alumni, over 50% of the 118 who responded said that they continued to work with farmworkers as a result of their SAF internship.","The main problem that Into the Fields addresses is Latino farmworkers’ lack of access to information about their rights, as well as lack of access to bilingual and bicultural health, education, and legal services. Having qualified, bilingual staff that have worked in the fields themselves, that come from farmworker families, or that are allies in the movement is key to developing outreach programs that can easily build trust with workers. By having interns working in different sectors, they are able to share information with each other about the respective resources available to farmworkers, refer workers to the appropriate agency, and promote collaboration among the different organizations. Since its inception as a nonprofit, SAF has developed the leadership of over 700 Into the Fields interns who have supported more than 80,000 farmworkers in the South. &nbsp; The program also allows us to have a long-term impact on young people and on the farmworker movement as a whole. There is a great need for leadership in the farmworker movement by young people, especially by students from farmworker families. Through SAF’s Into the Fields internship program, we develop the leadership of college students, the majority of whom are Mexican-American and from farmworker families. Into the Fields interns gain skills, resources, experience and connection to the farmworker movement, veteran activists, and farmworkers and their families. We know that by increasing their knowledge and experience in advocacy and activism, we will create a strong cohort of young people poised to take leadership in the Carolinas and across the country. &nbsp; Because of SAF’s partnerships with legal aid, rural health clinics, migrant education programs, labor unions, and community-based organizations, we are able to encourage young people to pursue careers in these diverse fields. We have seen long-term impacts of this program on SAF alumni who get hired by SAF partners, choose career paths working with farmworkers in rural areas, and continue to advocate for farmworkers throughout their lifetime. &nbsp; SAF will evaluate the program in three main ways: a focus group will be conducted with interns at the end of the program, partnering organizations will complete a written evaluation of the program, and annually, SAF will conduct a survey to evaluate the impact that participating in SAF has had on alumni’s ability to continue working with farmworkers.","SAF&#8217;s organizational budget is $709,196 &nbsp; Project budget: Intern stipends &amp; educational scholarships $62k Ayuda financiera y becas estudiantiles $62k &nbsp; Room &amp; board for two weeks orientation and retreats $10k Entrenamientos y retiros $10k &nbsp; Travel $8k Los gastos de viaje $8k &nbsp; TOTAL PROJECT $80k &nbsp;",,"Student Action with Farmworkers is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization whose mission is to bring students and farmworkers together to learn about each other’s lives, share resources and skills, improve conditions for farmworkers, and build diverse coalitions working for social change. &nbsp; SAF has been working on education reform, workers’ rights, and health and safety issues since its inception as a nonprofit.

Unidos encourages users to reach friends and family to encourage them to register and vote and become involved in the democratic process. Each year an estimated 800-thousand young Latinos in the U.S. turn 18 &#8211; voting age! That means nearly 3.2 million Latinx millennials will be eligible to vote for the first time in this year’s election. Their votes could be a pivotal factor in the race for president as well as congressional, state and local races across the U.S.","&#8220;What the Unidos app means to me is hope. It&#8217;s the feeling of solidarity that resonates with me while using the application.&#8221; – Felipe Guzman, 21, political science major at California State University at Northridge. Immigrant voters, especially Latinos, played a key role in the last 2 presidential contests, and are expected to be similarly pivotal in 2016. But while Hispanics have voted in record numbers in recent years, their turnout rate continues to lag significantly behind whites and blacks. Most forecasts predict that only half of eligible Latinos will vote in 2016. Unidos represents a bold new approach to breaking the historic trend of below-average Latino voter turnout. We’re a trusted non-partisan voice. We believe that every vote counts, and that it’s vitally important to use new technology to reach and engage the next generation of American voters. We believe that working together we can realize the dream of full Latino voter participation. That’s why we work with a range of advocacy organizations and media outlets including Mi Familia Vota, Impremedia (publisher of Spanish-language newspapers in New York, LA and other cities), LULAC, Public News Service and the Campus Election Engagement Project.

Our program uses a curriculum that is proven to decrease teen pregnancies, and our instructors, who are bilingual and bicultural, deliver the program in a way that encourages positive identity development and ensures Latinas are proud of cultural heritage. Right now, we only have the funds for one staff member to attend the training, making it difficult for us to reach more Latinas in Portland, OR.

Their children are more likely to continue in the same cycle of poverty.

This situation complicates the medicine administration making it difficult to provide proper care to the children. Why is it important? It is said that if hospital facilities, medical environment and equipment are within acceptable conditions, children will respond more positively to treatment. Therefore, with the purchase of 52 IV poles we will be improving the application for IV treatment to 235 patients, ensuring on the other hand, a better prognosis for the children.

While protections do exist to allow for lawful status for survivors of such sexual and domestic violence, many women and girls are unable to access or afford critical legal representation. As violence in Central America and Mexico increases, so has the number of women and girls fleeing rape and other gender-based violence. Since the summer of 2014, over 260,000 unaccompanied children and mothers with young children have made the treacherous journey. The urgency of this crisis is exacerbated by the vulnerability of the population. Many women and girls have fled severe sexual and physical violence. They also encounter this type of trauma on their journey. According to a recent study, an estimated 80% of women and girls crossing the border are raped during their journey. United Nations reports show that over 2/3rds of these individuals have viable asylum claims. Without an attorney, reports shows that an individual seeking protection in immigration court has only a 1 in 10 chance of avoiding deportation.

However, in most rural villages of Guatemala, factors of poverty, unemployment, and the lack of these ideal conditions cause children and youth to migrate in order to survive. Our grassroots project Brighten the Barrio supports indigenous Maya-K&#8217;iche children in the high-emigration area of Chuatroj, Totonicapán, where 75% of the total population lives under two dollars per day, and 25% live under one dollar per day. We believe in the power of education as the key to breaking the vicious cycles of poverty and migration. Our goal is to strengthen the potential capacity within each child so that they may obtain more future opportunities in their own country. The Brighten the Barrio scholarship fund was born in September of 2014 as the result of a dialogue between INCEDES (our parent organization, the Central American Institute of Social Studies and Development), the school cooperative, teachers, and community leaders of Chuatroj. We all wanted an initiative to overcome the factors of social vulnerability that the many families faced. Our model centers on providing school tuition to elementary through high school students ranked by need, while supporting them with a network of community pillars to ensure their academic, physical, and mental success. This network includes their family, peers, teachers, school board, local bank and the community administrative cooperative. Besides schooling, all together we promote their self-esteem, cultural identity, and encourage them to walk their lives with hope. The total $360 ($1/day) scholarship includes a monthly stipend including all their school fees, and a small portion for their healthcare, hygiene, and nutrition. In addition, five percent is added per month to a savings account in their name in order to promote financial responsibility and to invest in their futures. We ask YOU to help us invest in their futures as well with any amount of support. You will enable each child to achieve their aspirations so they may contribute back to society one day as change agents of their own. Our program is double the impact. At the individual and family level: Our program Targets girls and teenagers whose precarious economic, family, and community situation makes them highly vulnerable to dropping out of school, child labor, early marriage/pregnancy, and a lifetime of chronic illness, malnutrition, and extreme poverty. Our project lessens the impact of this situation on our students’ (and their families’) future and mitigates the pressure to migrate by providing them this educational opportunity and a minimum basic financial support. Fosters a culture that prioritizes a child’s right to schooling and involves parents in their child’s academic success. This is especially important in Guatemala where indigenous girls are systematically excluded from schooling due to cultural beliefs about traditional gender roles and the right of women to study. Allows impoverished families to gain experience of regular finances and introduces a saving mentality (as opposed to relying on their seasonal farming to live). As many of our families are single-mother homes, our project contributes to improved financial literacy and autonomy among women. Raises elementary (and soon secondary) school completion rates among Mayan children; Has the potential to increase the number of Mayan youth who pursue a university degree; Has the potential to increase the number of Mayan’ children who have access to healthcare during their critical growth period. At the community level: Our program Contributes to building a self-sufficient, organized, healthy village in the absence of support from the central government; Strengthens local capacities to collectively propose, implement, and administer projects directed at fomenting self-sufficiency and improving quality of life. We have established a quantitative baseline of requirements for scholars currently in the program, which allows us to measure improvements in grades and attendance over the course of their school career. We also conduct bi-annual evaluation meetings with Committee members and students to discuss students’ personal and academic progress and generate ideas for improving our impact. We are currently improving on defining measures to monitor living conditions and to provide greater support for mothers. Results: Last year our funding allowed us to provide scholarships tp 10 of the 27 students qualified for the program. Eight of them were young or teenage girls. Our scholars were identified and prioritized based on a set of criteria defined by the Chuatroj Scholarship Committee: orphaned, abandonment due to migration, or extreme poverty. In the case of a tie, priority was given to girls, given that gender inequality exaggerates their vulnerability. Earlier this year we actively campaigned and successfully met our goal to add 6 more girls from our &#8216;waiting list&#8221; along with securing support of our then-existing 10 scholars. This campaign we aim to support five more vulnerable kids &#8211; two high school boys, two middle school girls, and one elementary school girl.

At 3 years old, she was diagnosed with a tumor in the gluteal zone causing many discomforts such as intense pain, inflammation of the area and a permanent uncomfortable sensation. Doctors have stated that the tumor must be removed, however, given the location of the tumor, the surgery is considered to be high risk and very costly. Rosy, a single-mother of two, has brought up her two children in Ataco with limited resources and sacrifices. She works all day to barely support Julissa and her son. What she earns is not enough to provide Julissa with proper medical care or cover any surgery. The tumor, made up of a set of veins that feed on blood, is growing bigger with time and making it extremely uncomfortable for her. Despite this long and hard illness, Julissa does not lose her smile and her attitude towards life. Julissa is a very intelligent girl, and her condition has not interrupted her dreams of continuing her studies – now 16 years old, she is already studying her first year of high school. Through her sweet gaze, Julissa shared her immense Faith that soon she will be operated and put an end to this hard disease. Why is it important? Julissa has demonstrated a mature temper for her age. Her life has just begun and her dreams fly high above. Her greatest desire is to become a Doctor in order to have the opportunity to do good and become a source of hope for those who suffer serious illnesses. With this fundraising campaign, Julissa will have access to a private Doctor with the expertise to perform the surgery. For Julissa, this surgery will transform completely her life. How will the funds be used? The funds will go directly to cover medical and surgery costs.",,,,,ended,,,https://vimeo.com/193792868

To combat this epidemic, UNICEF recently began a program entitled Kid Power in schools across the United States. Through the program, classrooms are given smart bracelets that track students’ steps throughout the course of the day. For every 2,400 steps, the wearer earns a “kid power point.” Upon earning 10 points, UNICEF sends a therapeutic food packet to a malnourished child in one of their target countries. Like UNICEF, Mission Neighborhood Health Center’s pediatric health coaching program also aims to address the pediatric obesity epidemic in the United States. We are fundraising to provide these Kid Power bracelets for 10 or more of our health coaching patients whom we have determined would benefit the most from enrollment in the Kid Power program. These particular patients were selected because of their overall sedentary lifestyles. The Kid Power bracelets provide an incredible incentive to these patients to stay more active by invoking children’s natural desire to help others of their same age. Interest in the program is high amongst the target patients who were enthusiastic about wearing the bracelets. The bracelet, which they will be encouraged to wear continually, promotes the attainment of 12,000 steps per day, the daily activity goal recommended by the National Institute of Health. Furthermore, it is difficult for our health coaches to directly track the activity of their patients to ensure they are meeting their goals to stay active. The bracelets would allow them to do just that. Being rewarded for a simple activity like walking will encourage the health coaching patients to strive for a healthier lifestyle overall. This program offers long term benefits because the patient can keep the bracelet they are given as long as they show an active and intentional involvement during a small trial period. Your support will make it possible for us to intervene early in these children’s lives by attaching positive context and attainable goals to the habit of daily physical activity. Thank you!","Childhood obesity has become a complex issue in the United States. Approximately 32% of our nation’s youth are overweight or obese, an epidemic that affects low income Latino children even more drastically. The body mass index (BMI) of a patient allows us to know if their height and weight are in balance. A drastic rise in the BMIs of pediatric patients has been brought about by a myriad of factors including lack of nutrition education, high levels of inactivity, and increasing time spent on smart devices, among others. High BMIs caused by these environmental stressors lead to a decline in the quality of life of our children and put them at risk for many health concerns in the future including diabetes and hypertension. In the health coaching program, we believe that healthy children become healthy adults. Our goal is to intervene early in the lives of these patients to help them foster healthy and sustainable habits on their own. With the use of these Kid Power bracelets, we hope to see a shift in children’s mentalities surrounding physical activity from one of obligation to one of excitement and fun. The youth will be able to learn about new cultures around the world while helping both themselves and malnourished children become healthier. This change will principally be measured by documenting the changes in BMI of our target patients throughout a 5 month trial period. However, weight changes are not the only way to quantify the success of the project. Recipients of the bracelets will be asked to keep a journal and track their steps each day. We hope to see a significant increase in the number of steps each patient takes and therefore their overall activity level. Our ultimate goal is the attainment of 12,000 steps per day.","Each bracelet costs $40 from Target, UNICEF’s independent vendor. We have received non-profit tax exempt status from Target and shipping and handling are free of charge. Our goal is to provide at least 10 bracelets to our patients. Any funds raised that do not amount to enough to purchase an additional bracelet will be used to purchase healthy snacks to be given to patients during their individual meetings. Example of snacks to be purchased will be carrots and hummus, ants on a log, apples and peanut butter, and yogurt with fresh fruit.",,"Mission Neighborhood Health Center (MNHC) honors our Latino roots with a tradition of providing compassionate, patient-centered care. We advocate for health equity and deliver innovative, high quality services responsive to the neighborhoods and diverse communities we serve. MNHC was founded in 1967 to respond to the healthcare needs of low income families in the Mission neighborhood community in San Francisco. From the humble beginnings of delivering care in a trailer in the parking lot at our Shotwell Street site for $1 per visit, we have grown to become an integral part of the community. Each year, MNHC serves nearly 13,000 patients at its four sites in the Mission and Excelsior neighborhoods of San Francisco. MNHC delivers primary health care services across the life-cycle including prenatal care, pediatrics, teen services, family planning, women’s health services and adult and senior medicine. MNHC also provides specialized HIV services at its Clinica Esperanza and a program of support and health services to the homeless through our Mission Neighborhood Resource Center. The health coaching program at MNHC (which this fundraiser will benefit) has been run for the past three years by our resident AmeriCorps member. Our pediatric providers refer patients who are overweight or obese to the health coach, who then sets up a one on one meeting with the patient and their parents. Over the course of several sessions, the patient and health coach set small, achievable goals to help the patient attain a healthier lifestyle by creating sustainable healthy habits.",ended,20160322.0,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rraLHsXSUAs

Objetivo: Construir un aula de preescolar y un comedor para niños y niñas de 17 aldeas de Cobán, Altaverapaz Problema que se enfrenta: Las mujeres y los niños son las poblaciones más vulnerables en Guatemala. En general, en Guatemala, los pueblos indígenas viven en condiciones más precarias que la población ladina o el promedio nacional. Guatemala es el quinto país con más desnutrición crónica en el mundo. El departamento de la Altaverapaz, es uno de los que manejan un mayor porcentaje de desnutrición infantil y analfabetismo del país. La mal nutrición y el analfabetismo son dos factores que impiden el desarrollo humano y económico en las comunidades y del país. El impacto deseado de este proyecto se traduce en una mejora sustancial del estado de la educación, salud y la nutrición de los niños integrados al programa y sus madres. Con los fondos recaudados se construirán en un aula y un comedor. ¿Cómo se utilizarán los fondos? En esta campaña soñamos recaudar 10 mil dólares. Esto representa el 50% del costo total de la escuela y el comedor. Si logramos recaudar 5mil dolares: comenzaremos y estarías casi con todas las paredes de un aula. Si recaudamos 10mil dólares: comenzaremos y terminaremos el aula de preescolar y comenzaríamos las paredes del comedor.

With the proper equipment and building more medical clinics in these rural communities “Ayuda a Corazón de Niño” will be treating and diagnosing children who other wise would not have this opportunity. Impact: Through your donations we will be able to purchase a portable electrocardiograph needed to visit the rural communities to diagnose and treat children with any heart condition with proven technology to provide the proper medical care necessary for each child. Your donation represent an opportunity to save and diagnose thousands of children in need of medical care.",,,,,ended,,,https://youtu.be/btOKS6zQjfQ

In the past 10 years, with increase in institutionalized birth, cesarean rates have tripled among Indigenous women reaching 60%&nbsp;and breast feeding rates are at a historic low of 14%. Women are terrified of attending the hospital due to institutionalized violence and racism. Just this year, 49 women have died in Chiapas of pregnancy related causes, placing Chiapas third highest in mortality rate in Mexico. Globally we know that midwifery care prevents maternal and neonatal deaths, through skilled, knowledgeable and compassionate care. The midwifery model of Luna Maya in Chiapas sustains a 9% cesarean rate, and 95% breastfeeding rate at six weeks. In 11 years of operating we have never had a maternal death, and women cared for by Luna Maya are empowered as women and mothers, their husbands are included and encouraged to support their partners and learn how to actively participate in birth and postpartum support, and their families encouraged to welcome the new generation in peace and love. We need your support to continue to provide excellent care to all women. Indigenous women pay approximately 10% ($1.50 for prenatals and $20 a birth) of the cost of services and your support will allow us to continue our open door policy. Each $100 provides prenatal, birth and well woman care for one family, ensuring respect, cultural competence and evidence based midwifery care. In 2017 we want to support 70 families. &nbsp; Why it matters? Although Mexico is now considered a high middle income country, there remain disparities in health, wealth and social issues across the 32 federal entities. Situated in the south east on the border of Guatemala, Chiapas is one such region that presents challenges to Mexico’s image as a global economic power. On the one hand Chiapas is extraordinarily rich in natural resources and is the most geographically and culturally diverse state in Mexico. Access to health services is particularly poor and is associated with wider political economic and social issues. Chiapas has the third highest maternal mortality ratio (68.1 per every 100, 000 live births) and the highest infant mortality (17.9 per every 1000 children under 5yrs) in the country as a whole (INEGI 2013). This project contributes to the strengthening and integration of professional midwifery in Mexico. It is based on the principles of the midwifery model: focused on women’s needs, continuity of care, support networks, and collaboration and safety of care based on evidence and profound respect for women´s cultural values and needs. Established on August 25, 2004, Luna Maya Birth Center &nbsp;has provided over a decade of service provision to women and their families in San Cristóbal de Las Casas in Chiapas, Mexico and recently in Mexico City. In addition to expanding beyond traditional midwifery services, Luna Maya broadened the very meaning of midwifery. From its inception, the midwives at Luna Maya have understood that the state of maternal services in Chiapas necessitated a woman-focused, humanized intervention to employ the broadest meaning of women’s health. Responding to this environment of limited care options, Luna Maya has not only stressed the importance of holistic care, which addresses the psychosocial needs of its clients, but has also provided alternative healing as an alternative to the allopathic framework of popular medical models of maternal care. Moreover, Luna Maya has created a model that understands that the individual is linked to and informed by her environment, which includes her family and community. This project allows for continued access of all women, specifically indigenous women to Luna Maya services. &nbsp; How will the funds be used? Every dollar donated to the campaign helps one indigenous family access prenatal, birth and well woman care services. $100 provides full course of care to a pregnant family ensuring safe and compassionate midwifery care. Funds help subsidize services for low income indigenous families, and ensure that no family is turned away from lack of resources. Care includes one hour prenatal visits with one of two professional midwives, home or birth center birth, three postpartum and lactation home visits and well woman care including family planning and pap smears. Our goal for 2017 is to be able to reach 70 families.",,,,,ended,,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OV4rzk01P0I &nbsp;

It transcends differences of language, of country of origin, of geography. It unites us in a way that only the most dire of emergencies can. It is a crisis of humanity, one that requires a basic, human response: Heart. For decades, Alianza Americas has worked across borders to fight injustice, oppression, and inequality. And as the crisis facing migrant families, children, and marginalized people across the Americas grows, the urgency and immediacy of our work also grows. Join us in putting our “hearts”&#8211;resources, action, compassion and resistance&#8211;on the ground, across borders to protect migrant families and defend their human rights. How we will put your donations in action: #HeartsAcrosstheAmericas will work across borders to protect and defend migrant families in their home countries, along the migration route, and in the United States. The effort builds on Alianza Americas’ 15 years of experience in transnational advocacy and organizing to advance justice, dignity and human rights across the Americas. ·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Central America: Coordinated advocacy, resources, and partnerships to end the systemic violence, impunity, and inequality driving families from their homes. ·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Mexico: Direct financial support to shelters housing migrant families and mobilization of legal experts to ensure that families understand their rights to seek asylum. ·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the United States: Networked legal services and know-your-rights trainings for migrant families and migrant-led organizing around legislation that protects families across borders. Add your “heart” to the mobilization of #HeartsAcrosstheAmericas. Your donation will support Alianza Americas’ transnational effort to build safety, support and protections migrant families across borders. Why it matters: Central American families and migrant communities are in acute crisis. The systemic poverty, corruption and violence that plagues countries like Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and Nicaragua has been exacerbated by decades of short-sighted, punitive economic and immigration policies from the United States. And now, the abject lack of basic regard for humane treatment with which the current administration has attacked immigrant and refugee families puts them at immediate risk. The resurgence of white supremacy, rising xenophobia, and nationalism is reaching across borders, adding to this toxic mix across the Americas. Families face death if they stay home; persecution and separation if they flee. Potential Challenges: Well-intentioned, short-term responses fail to capture the deeply historic and transnational dimensions of the challenge at hand. While there is no silver bullet to tackling a situation as complex as the one facing Central American migrants, work toward a solution must include all stakeholders across the U.S.-Central America migration corridor. In defending migrant families, we seek support from concerned people across the Americas.

It is necessary to continue shining a light on these heartless and senseless actions. We need to keep the pressure on and do everything we can to put an end to these practices. We believe these raids are misguided and they are an absolutely erroneous waste of tax payer’s dollars. Instead of using our tax dollars to to detain and deport children, we should be using taxpayers dollars to help these families secure competent legal representation and help them argue their cases in Immigration Courts. Read our full statement here. As a country who believes in the values of democracy, liberty and justice, we should be providing families with a due process.

EBSC’s clients are from underrepresented and especially vulnerable groups, including indigenous Guatemalans, Unaccompanied Children, LGBT individuals, torture victims, and victims of gender-based violence. EBSC’s Gender-Based Violence program assists women and girls who have fled their home countries due to extreme abuse, including sexual violence, domestic violence, female genital mutilation, and forced marriage. EBSC assists 75 women and girls yearly. EBSC supports these women and girls by helping them to secure asylum in the United States. Asylum is granted to individuals who were persecuted in their home country, and who are afraid of being persecuted if they return, due to their race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a social group. Through the asylum application process, these individuals are allowed to work in the United States, and after they are granted asylum, they can petition for their family members, and apply for residency, placing them on the path to become U.S. citizens. Providing pro-bono or low cost immigration services to asylum seekers who cannot afford a legal representative is important, since the United States does not guarantee legal representation to asylum seekers. Without the legal assistance offered by EBSC, these indigent asylum seekers will otherwise not be able to navigate the complicated U.S. asylum process. EBSC’s social services, such as free English as a Second Language classes, assistance with enrollment in school, vocational training, and job referrals, help to facilitate the process of integration, rebuilding, and healing. These women have fled countries where their families, communities, or state institutions have failed to protect them. The services provided by EBSC helps to lay the foundations to help them rebuild their lives in the United States.","Violence against women has a tragic presence in our society. Globally, 1 in 3 women experiences physical or sexual violence in her lifetime[1]. Central American countries, including El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras have some of the highest rates of femicide in the world[2]. Perpetrators of violence against women include intimate partners, family members, and the state. Despite the presence of legislation addressing violence against women, many are not offered protection from state or local authorities, leaving them no choice but to flee their countries[3]. &nbsp; EBSC has historically worked with clients fleeing various forms of gender-based violence. During the civil wars in Central America in the 1980s, gender-based violence, especially in Guatemala, was not a consequence of the war, but a systematized weapon used against the indigenous population. Mayan women suffered atrocious persecution as a result of brutal sexual violence in addition to other physical abuse and torture. Gang rape of elderly women and young girls, forced abortions and sterilizations, and the rape, torture and killing of pregnant women are some of the well-documented atrocities committed against Mayan women. Since 1982, EBSC worked with hundreds of indigenous women who have visited our basement office to seek protection from the abuse they suffered at the hands of state actors in Guatemala. &nbsp; Current high levels of violence in Central America have been especially dangerous for women. According to a study released by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, women report that in addition to violence at home, they and their children are now at an added risk of violence from gangs[4]. &nbsp; Gender-based violence has a devastating effect on its victims, through physical and mental health afflictions, as well as on children witnessing violence and society at-large. Through its free or low-cost asylum service, EBSC&rsquo;s gender-based violence program offers protection to these women as they begin to rebuild their new lives in the United States. &nbsp; Following are a few examples of gender-based violence cases we represent: &nbsp; I am an indigenous 18-year-old from Central America. In my small village there are no police officers, so for many years since the civil war in my country, men have organized to patrol the streets in groups at night. Each household must participate in this patrol. When my parents became too ill to patrol, the members of the patrol told me that I would need to join them. If I refused, they said they would hurt me or my family. I patrolled with them for a few weeks. During those weeks I saw the men in the patrol beat people who they saw out past curfew, and take women into the woods with them. One man in the patrol told me that I had to be his girlfriend and when I refused, he hit me. Fearing retribution, I fled by myself to the United States. I was detained by immigration at the border and after weeks in detention, I was released to relatives in the Bay Area. Since I have been here, the patrol has gone to my parents&rsquo; house and threatened that if I return, they will kill me. &nbsp; I am a 17-year-old teenager from Central America. My father disappeared when I was a baby and my mother struggled to support me and my nine older brothers and sisters. When I was 12, I moved in with my boyfriend, who lived down the street and who was 22 at the time. I had my first son when I was 13 years-old, and my second son when I was 15. My boyfriend did not treat me well, and after my second son was born he left me. After he left, his mother tried to come and take my two little boys away from me, threatening to hurt me if I refused. Fearing for myself and my sons, I travelled alone with my 1 and 3 year old to the United States. We were detained at the border and placed in a detention facility for weeks before being released to my aunt in the Bay Area. &nbsp; [1] http://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/ending-violence-against-women/facts-and-figures [2] http://www.smallarmssurvey.org/fileadmin/img/highlights/Femicide-RN14-fig2.pdf &nbsp; [3] http://www.unhcr.org/5630f24c6.html [4] http://www.unhcr.org/5630f24c6.html &nbsp;","Organization Total Budget: &nbsp;$1,099,670.93 Personnel: $876,855.31 Supplies: $33,300 Rent &amp; Utilities: $7,936 Direct Assistance: $139,500 Miscellaneous Cost: $42,079.62 &nbsp; Project Total Budget: $70,473.72 Personnel: $70,143.72 Miscellaneous Cost: $330",,"In 1982, East Bay Sanctuary Covenant (EBSC) grew out of, and largely shaped, the Sanctuary movement which was responding to the influx of Central American refugees escaping to the United States. In 1992, EBSC developed its Affirmative Asylum Program, which we have been told is one of the largest asylum programs in the United States. In 2006, EBSC launched its Community Development and Education program to assist clients with employment training, medical assistance, cash and food stamp assistance, higher education, leadership development, and to learn English and prepare for the U.S. citizenship examination. Currently, EBSC directly serves over 2,000 immigrants and refugees in the Bay Area. EBSC works especially closely with vulnerable groups within the Bay Area&rsquo;s immigrant and refugee community, who are often the most highly traumatized, yet underserved. These vulnerable groups include indigenous Guatemalans, LGBT or HIV-positive individuals, victims of gender-based violence, and unaccompanied children. &nbsp; There is a clear need for EBSC&rsquo;s services, now, more than ever. For more than 30 years, EBSC has been dedicated to serving the immigrant and refugee community, and continues to be the source of guidance and support for thousands of vulnerable members of this community. EBSC is one of the few organizations that accepts walk-in clients. Our services are free or low-cost, and no one is turned away for lack of ability to pay. In this way, EBSC continues to fulfill its mission to provide sanctuary including protection advocacy, support and empowerment to low-income and poverty stricken asylum-seekers. &nbsp;",ended,20160229.0,EBaySanctuary,

They decided to add a boot bracelet that could be worn on the boots &amp; on the wrist too, and that&#8217;s how Wakami got involved in the project; these bracelets are also handmade too by Guatemalan artisans. We are happy to help them create more jobs with this project! Contrary to popular belief, technology is not a luxury, but the tool we need to transform tomorrow&#8217;s leaders. Reinforcing school and tutorial center DBO Ministries is located approximately 60 km from the capital city of Guatemala in Chimaltenango. Despite being near the shopping area, the center helps children at social risk and street condition, among the, shoe polishers that work at the central park. After a deep effort from Passion Association, who provides tools for children and young people from vulnerable populations, to build the DBO House with an appropriate kitchen, living room for recreational activities, food bank, they managed to build a technology room with the required conditions to be equipped with computers which will benefit near one hundred children, teenagers, young and adult people in social risk, which have been unable to access to formal education or digital world training. All involved we want to transform the access to technology into a right, not a privilege, and that the children with this center can have access to this wonderful educational tool, which will expand their horizons and introduce them to a whole new world of possibilities. With technology inside their classroom, these children will have the chance to acquire the minimum competencies and skills they need to face today’s highly advanced world. Then, tomorrow they will become part of the important workforce that moves Guatemala. To achieve this we need a total of US$5,500. With this money we will equip the center with a computer lab with the most advanced programs like Khan Academy. In addition, Funsepa will provide the necessary school training in the usage of technology as an educational tool, and will also be carrying out monitoring and evaluation of the impact that this lab will have in the life of this young children.","Guatemala is a country where 51% of the population lives in poverty and 17% is illiterate. We firmly believe that an advanced nation is shaped by educated people, but in Guatemala there still a lot to do in this matter. This effort to equip all public schools in the country with technology, and train teachers in the usage of this tool inside the classroom, is a step in the right direction. Today children face a world much more demanding and competitive. We must provide them a different type of education, an education that makes them dream and aspire to be professionals. This would, in principle, open their minds into a whole new world, full of possibilities. It would expand their horizons early on, so their curiosity and desire of knowledge. But, most importantly, these children will realize that education is the most valuable tool they have to succeed. For this reason, the foundation provides sustained accompaniment throughout the process. It trains teachers into using technology inside the classroom and how to make the most of it. Besides, the school is exposed to a constant monitoring and evaluation, which helps determine their strengths and weaknesses. It is important to mention that Funsepa works in constant communication with the Ministry of Education in Guatemala, serving as their “technological arm”.

Women generally are at a high risk of domestic violence, however, immigration status, language barriers, and social isolation can be used as a tool by an abuser against immigrant women to increase their hold of power and further their control in the relationship. Our goal is to provide legal representation to immigrant women who are victims of domestic violence so that they may seek a path to citizenship and work towards increasing their economic security. By applying for VAWA, a form of immigration relief that is made eligible to certain immigrants who are victims of domestic violence, women can be put on a path to citizenship, given a work permit, and access healthcare. Your donation will allow us to fund our services, so that immigrant women can access our legal services regardless of their economic status.","A national study demonstrated that access to immigration legal services is the public service that most significantly reduces domestic abuse in crime victims, more so than counseling and case management services. This is because the tangible protections that clients gain from legal services, such as legal immigration status, work authorization, and eligibility for public benefits stemming from immigration status, present them with real, long-term alternatives to their abusive relationship, thus increasing their self-sufficiency.

At the New Mexico Immigrant Law Center, we envision a vibrant country where all people—regardless of their immigration status—can achieve their full potential and are treated with dignity and respect. This vision seems a lot harder to achieve now—but we are not about to let up. Now more than ever, we need your support to make our vision a reality and ensure that ALL New Mexicans have access to the justice they deserve. In the new political climate, our community’s needs are changing, and NMILC’s services will adjust accordingly. While the future is uncertain, NMILC is actively preparing various strategies to employ over the next four years, including increased focus on deportation defense, offering “Know Your Rights” trainings to immigrant communities, performing more screenings of students to see if they are eligible for a permanent immigration status, and keeping a vigilant eye on legislation and policies proposed by the president elect and incoming Congress. Your funds will give us the flexibility we need to fight whatever gets thrown our way, come inauguration day. Why it matters? The proposed immigration policies of the president-elect include: Revoking President Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival’s program, which allows undocumented students to receive temporary work permits and protection from deportation Cancelling federal funding for cities that have policies protected undocumented immigrants from federal immigration law. Deporting more than 2 million “criminal” undocumented immigrants, with a definition of “criminal” that includes being convicted of drunken driving. Suspending immigration from “terror-prone regions” Establishing a 2-year mandatory minimum federal prison sentence for illegally re-entering the U.S. after a previous deportation, and 5-year mandatory minimum sentence for those with felony convictions, multiple misdemeanor convictions, or two or more prior deportations &nbsp; While much remains uncertain about what exactly these policies will look like and if/when they will be implemented, we do know that the president elect has already created an atmosphere that is hostile to immigrant communities. NMILC exists to ensure that immigrants have access to the justice they deserve, and no election results will deter us from continuing our advocacy in a nation of laws that protect human rights. &nbsp; With your support and the continued courage and resiliency of the immigrant community, we will keep fighting for the rights of immigrants in New Mexico and throughout the country.

Their shift begins at 6pm to 2:30 in the morning when they are invisible to the office workers who have already gone home for the day. Property service workers include janitors, security officers, maintenance and custodial workers, stadium, arena and airport workers, and represent a predominately immigrant workforce. Many are the heads of their households and work multiple jobs to support their families. They are hardworking individuals who want to participate and give back to their community, but often lack the educational resources, English language skills, and citizenship rights to do so. Building Skills Partnership (BSP) is a nonprofit and collaboration between businesses, the union and community partners. We serve a hard to reach immigrant population to provide pathways to citizenship and active civic engagement. Through Citizenship classes offered in Los Angeles, San Diego, Orange County, San Jose, Sacramento, and Oakland, janitors are given the tools necessary to pass their exam and achieve their dream of becoming an American citizen. More importantly, janitors are eager to give back to their community and want to make their voices heard. Your support will help us achieve our goal to continue delivering programming in 7 regions and help deepen our work in newer sites such as (OC, Silicon Valley, Sac, SD) in two ways. First, by providing legal services and consultation that is both attentive to immigration policy and able to help immigrant workers navigate additional routes to citizenship. Second, the funds raised will help us implement an initiative to raise civic and voter consciousness among janitorial workers.","Immigrant communities are an increasingly strong political and civic force. Becoming a naturalized citizen opens multiple doors to participate and give back to society, but is only the first step to creating civically engaged citizens. It is essential that we not only continue to expand Citizenship services but give immigrant workers the confidence and skills to participate in changing or enacting the policies that affect them.","With the resources generated through the HIPGive campaign, BSP will conduct a series of citizenship and voter engagement information sessions in the geographic areas served.

How much is giving a child a Nurturing Father worth? PRICELESS,"A Nurturing Father is a man who actively provides guidance, love, and support to enhance the development and growth of children for whom he cares. The goal of the Nurturing Fathers project is to provide fathers with the knowledge, emotional exploration, and support needed to achieve this aspiration. Research demonstrates that the involvement of caring, responsible fathers offers many positive benefits for children. Typically, children who grow up with an involved father do better in school, are less likely to drop out, have higher self-esteem, experience fewer emotional and behavioral problems, are less likely to engage in criminal behavior, and are less likely to engage in high risk behaviors such as drug use and early sexual activity. Each weekly class of 2 ½ hours (15 weeks) helps fathers deal with their feelings, manage anger, resolve conflicts, engage in appropriate play, teach values, and be a role model. Participants explore their experiences with their own fathers, and learn about their children’s needs and how to meet them. They learn why they need to be their children’s first teachers, and how important it is to provide loving praise, guidance, and a nurturing and secure environment for their children to gain self-esteem and confidence. Emphasis is also placed on maintaining a positive and supportive co-parenting relationship with the child(ren)’s mother, whether the parents are together or separated. Children need loving relationships with their fathers as well as their mothers in order to thrive. Participation in this program will strengthen positive father-child engagement, encourage family formation and strengthening, and develop effective skills for healthy family relationships and child development. Long-term outcomes will be stability in parent-child and familial relationships and for the fathers. This stability will enable families to better obtain other life objectives, such as additional education and life-sustaining employment. Your donations could help to achieve that!

The city that Enlace serves – Holyoke, Massachusetts – has a population of 40,249, of which 48.4% are Hispanic. Compared to other cities in Massachusetts, Holyoke has the highest percentage of children living in poverty, the highest teen birth rate, and the second highest percentage of children living in single-parent families. Additionally, 31.5% of the population is below the poverty rate. Poverty is especially prevalent among its growing population of teenage Latina mothers and their young children; 62% of Holyoke’s impoverished children are Latino. In 2012 the Massachusetts Alliance on Teen Pregnancy reported a teen pregnancy rate in Holyoke of 57.1 per 1,000 girls ages 15 to 19 compared to 14 per 1,000 girls in the state in the same age group. Additionally, Census Bureau figures show that one-third of the adult population in the city has not completed high school and that nearly one-third (29%) of all Holyoke high school students drop out of school. Holyoke has a per capita income of $18,016 compared to the state at $35,485 and its unemployment rate for the 16 to 24 year old age group is 33% compared to the national unemployment rate of 22.1%. This is a city in need. Enlace provides a variety of services to city and county residents and believes that strong families make strong communities. The Nurturing Fathers program is one way to positively affect all members of a family and to give them the opportunity to improve their quality of life! Enlace wishes to give as many fathers as it can the opportunity to participate in the Nurturing Fathers program because research demonstrates that the involvement of caring, responsible fathers offers many positive benefits for children. Typically, children who grow up with an involved father do better in school, are less likely to drop out, have higher self-esteem, experience fewer emotional and behavioral problems, are less likely to engage in criminal behavior, and are less likely to engage in high risk behaviors such as drug use and early sexual activity. Success for this project can be measured in a variety of ways. To determine short-term outcomes, Enlace looks at the number of fathers successfully completing the program, which indicates that: Fathers have an increased knowledge about child development and parenting Fathers have learned appropriate parenting skills Fathers have an increased awareness of the importance of ongoing involvement with and monetary support for their children Intermediate outcomes include fathers using their newly acquired parenting skills and increasing their level of involvement with and/or financial support of their child(ren). Long-term outcomes that result from the Nurturing Fathers program are stability in parent-child relationships, in familial relationships, and for the fathers. This stability will enable families to better obtain other life objectives, such as additional education and/or life-sustaining employment. The behavior of the participating fathers’ children is another possible measure. For example, do these children perform better in school? Personal testimonials from project participants can be found in the following article, http://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2016/07/nurturing_fathers_program_cele.html This project has value beyond the local community of Holyoke.

The goal of the Mariposas Environmental Service Adventures is to empower young women, adopt healthy behaviors, positively contribute to the community, and develop a deeper understanding of Mexico and the world’s environmental issues. This is accomplished through informal learning activities aimed to increase participant understanding of their full potential and girls’ rights as well as strengthening their knowledge and skill development in digital literacy, science, and technology. All of these things lead to greater educational or employment opportunities. With your financial support, we can raise the funds to send 8 young women on the inaugural Environmental Service Adventures trip and empower these young women to reach their full potential. What will the girls be doing? Each of the 10-days are broken into activities related to the three main focus areas of the program: Community Service, Environmental Education and Adventure. Where will they be working and learning? Akumal is Mayan for “Place of the Turtle” which is home to green and loggerhead turtles. In this beautiful, inspirational setting, daily activities include a variety of service, educational lessons, and adventures, including: sea turtle education and conservation; personal development and health sessions; survival swimming; community outreach at a library with local children; cultural exploration; and more. By partnering with local environmental and outreach organizations we are able to work with local experts in various fields to provide a comprehensive educational program.","Mexico faces major social and health challenges due to the high prevalence of teenage pregnancy. One out of two sexually active females between the ages of 12 to 19 have been pregnant[1]. Teenage pregnancy increases the probability of dropping out of school, increases poverty levels, low income jobs, and results in a high risk of maternal death.[2] Due to an inadequate educational system and lower value of educating girls and other gender-based disparities in Mexico, women, face a lack of programs and resources focusing on leadership, education and professional skills.[3] One of the key ways young girls can avoid teenage pregnancy is through access to continued education but only 25% of Mexican women ages 15-29 are not receiving an education or employee. Educating young women does not only have a positive impact on the individual but for every extra year of primary school boosts a girl’s future wage 10 to 20 percent and an extra year of secondary school increases that earning potential by 15 to 25 percent and according to the World Bank increasing the share of women with a secondary education by 1 percent boosts annual per capita income growth of a Country by 0.3 percentage points.

Due to lack of education and social support, the participating mothers are limited in their ability to find well-paying jobs that will enable them to comfortably support their families. These mothers are held back because of the limited communication skills as well as a lack of skills required in the workforce. Funds raised during this campaign will go towards childcare necessary for enabling the mothers to participate and payment for professional instructors in literacy and food management. Through literacy courses conducted by professional educators, the participating mothers will enhance their communication skills which will assist them in both their professional and personal lives. While workforce training is essential for gaining access to the opportunities for the young mothers and their families, education goes beyond labor marketability. Through literacy training, the mothers will acquire new information. The literacy training will not only improve their lives, but also provide increased academic, social and emotional support to their children. Increased literacy capabilities can also assist them in finding more opportunities in their workplaces. In order to enable the participating mothers to receive increased and improved employment opportunities, they will participate in food management and nutrition training. These training will help the participating mothers learn skills that they can take with them into the job market. Additionally, the participating mothers can have increased income. This educational program will provide the support these 10 young Latina mothers need to advance their lives and the lives of their children resulting in them being more self-reliant and productive members of society. Barbara Chambers Children’s Center has been serving the Latino community in Washington D.C. since 1968. We have strong connections and trust with the families that participate in our school and we want to serve them efficiently and effectively. This educational program will be a step forward in our mission to help improve the lives of the families in our community. Para mejorar las vidas de diez madres jóvenes e inmigrantes Barbara Chambers Children’s Center aspira a proveer clases de alfabetización y entrenamiento laboral en el manejo de alimentos. Debido a una carencia de educación y apoyo social, muchas de nuestras madres jóvenes están limitadas en sus habilidades de encontrar trabajo con suficiente pago que podría empoderarles a dar una vida más confortable y segura a sus familias. Las oportunidades de estas madres están refrenados por una falta de habilidades comunicativas y habilidades demandadas en la fuerza de trabajo. Fondos colectados en esta campaña serán usados para dos recursos: cuidado infantil necesario para permitir la participación de las madres, y pago para instructores profesionales en alfabetización y manejo de alimentos.","The reason why this campaign is important is simple: increasing the literacy and job skills of our young Latina mothers will improve their lives. And by improving the lives of these mothers, their children’s lives will be improved. On a broader level, a community with happier, more secure mothers and children will be a better place to live. The women that this program will assist are in need of the support and Barbara Chambers Children’s Center is in the position to provide it. We just need the financial resources. As common sense would suggest and formal studies such as those conducted by the Urban Institute confirm, illiteracy is correlated with poverty. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, Hispanics are the least literate racial/ethnic group in the United States and at the time of the study the literacy rate showed a retrogression (http://nces.ed.gov/naal/pdf/2006470_1.pdf). For those concerned about the economic and social outcomes of Hispanics living in poverty, or anyone living in poverty and in the cloud of illiteracy, this is clearly cause for concern. We want to assist in improving the lives of the mothers in our community. We want to help to improve our community. By providing poor mothers with job skills training they will be able to earn better jobs. By providing mothers with literacy they can gain exposure to whole new parts of the world.","ACTIVIDAD RECURSO UNIDAD COSTO UNITARIO TOTAL 1.

We&#8217;re here to change that. 12+ partners with high schools in underserved communities to help redefine what is possible for their students. Our mission is to foster learning environments that empower students towards a successful post-secondary pathway. Through our research-driven, school-based approach, we transform culture by focusing on the environment, the people, and the message. Throughout every school day, students access our PLUS Centers, vibrant hubs with resources for college access and academic success. Our site-based teams support every student in the school, not just a select few, to affect student mindsets and build a culture that manifests in sustainable, school-wide change. 12+ offers a wide range of programming, including transition support, college readiness, college access, college persistence, and leadership development. Most importantly, 12+ strives to build meaningful relationships that place the well-being of the student as the highest priority. By developing relational trust, 12+ steadily fosters a community where students are empowered to succeed academically. 12+ partners with Kensington Health Sciences Academy, where over 50% of the student body is Latino and which is located in one of the poorest congressional districts in the nation. Your support will directly benefit students by contributing to programs to help them succeed. Our students live in a world where over 90% will be the first in their families to go to college. As they boldly embark on this journey, your donation sends a powerful message that you believe in their potential and that they are not alone.","Many of our students desire to go to college, but applying, enrolling, and eventually persisting in postsecondary education involves a myriad of support that do not always exist for our students. With significant budget cuts in the School District, many college counseling programs are slashed or must focus on other responsibilities within the school. At Kensington Health Sciences Academy, counselors have many other responsibilities and are unable to provide students with the personalized attention that they require. Students are left to navigate procedures on their own. Students often believe that college is not a feasible option for them, based on lack of precedent in their schools and family structures. However, in today’s economy, a postsecondary education is an essential qualification for the majority of jobs, and even more critical for students of a lower economic background who may have fewer social networks and resources to rely on. We work with students every step of the way, from their first day of high school to after they graduate. We monitor class attendance, grades, involvement in 12+ workshops, and progress in the college application process. We gather indicators of culture through both student and faculty surveys. We believe that these students can succeed, with proper support and guidance. We believe that we can and must change school cultures, to empower students to achieve more, and to inspire success within the student body.","The total project budget is $87,550.

SLI, however, is committed to the young women that are actively trying to reject the status quo by pursuing their academic excellence. These Latinas have high academic potential and a unique zeal to pursue higher education. Regardless of their high academic achievement, our students face the challenge of finding financial resources every year. Our undocumented students are especially affected by the fact that they cannot receive federal or state-based financial aid. This HIPGive fundraiser will empower Latina scholars, not only to continue their education, but to become leaders in their communities, as well as role models and mentors to other young Latinas as well. As education continues to level the playing field for marginalized groups by cultivating knowledge and leadership, we are beyond proud of our female-identified mentees as they aim to inspire positive change within their communities. This project will make it possible for our female SLI students to overcome the financial barriers that may limit them from pursuing higher education. Your donations, no matter how large or small, can make the difference in helping us reach our goal of $10,000. Even small contributions, when pooled with gifts from others, can help mitigate some of the obstacles that hinder our students’ paths towards college education.","“Latinas continue to encounter obstacles like low expectations, financial constraints, and a lack of knowledge about what it takes to apply and graduate from college” (Horwedel). Yet, as a three year mentoring program, SLI aims to close the gap in the college access pipeline for Latina students by ensuring one-on-one mentorship and guidance throughout the college application process. One-hundred percent of our SLI graduates finish high school in contrast to the national average: 76% of high school students. Although SLI has been successful in adequately preparing students that are accepted to four-year universities, some SLI students are unable to attend college or no longer remain enrolled due to financial pressures. Financial support is a vital resource needed to close the gap that prevents our Latina students from accessing higher education. This scholarship fund is a tangible way to show our Latina students that SLI is not just about advice on how to apply to and succeed in college. Rather, we are committed to aiding their success in every way possible, including removal of financial obstacles. A $1,000 scholarship for each Latina student would alleviate some of the financial burden that is inevitably placed upon these students and their families.

Haiti is more poor, but Haiti is suffering economic and social disaster. Young people in Nicaragua are very hungry for educational opportunity. &nbsp; Why It Matters: When young women have educational opportunity it allows them more control over their lives. They are able to make better choices for their families. Stronger families are the basis for strong communities. Our students provide role models for other young people, in a culture that has not valued education for girls. &nbsp; How Funds Are Used (Comprehensive Support): In impoverished communities there are many impediments to educational success. To help students succeed Posibilidad provides: Tuition and Fees, Health and Dental Care, Tutoring and Transportation. Cervical Cancer is the biggest cancer killer of Nicaraguan women. 80% of adult Nicaraguan women are infected with HPV, so we provide students OB/Gyn care and Cervarix HPV vaccination. &nbsp; 2007 thru 2016: Nineteen students served.

Since its inception, the Foundation has been committed to supporting education through different approaches, including a teacher’s mini-grant program all the way to the implementation of a coaching strategy targeting teachers, principals, parents and the community. The Foundation has worked with more than 100 public schools and 500 teachers to impact the academic and social transformation of at least 50,000 students in the island.","The Puerto Rico Community Foundation has recognized and acted on the importance of supporting and leading efforts to strengthen the quality of our education throughout the Island. One of the main challenges that our public schools have faced is non-compliance with adequate yearly progress metrics. In the 2010-2011 school year there were 949 schools that did not meet the academic goals. In 2012 we became an ally to work with schools under the School Improvement Grant (SIG) to serve some of those who were in the bottom 5 % of lowest achievement schools. Our interventions at the Alejandro Tapia and Rivera School, Dr. Alfredo Aguayo School and Dr. José Celso Barbosa School provided great results. For example, at the Alejandro Tapia and Rivera School, 43% of 4th grade students increased their proficiency level in Spanish, 21% of 5th grade students increased their proficiency level in math and 33% in English, and 29% of 6th grade students increased their proficiency level in Spanish. One of the most significant achievements was the improvement in the school environment, teachers and students attendance and parents participation in their kid’s activities. The Foundation&#8217;s ongoing work in the area of education is extremely important. As the island faces the fiscal crisis, our schools continue to suffer budget and staff cuts, seriously affecting the development of our children and youth. Our mission as an organization is to develop the capacities of communities so that they themselves can achieve their social and economic transformation.

We make it possible; we give children the chance and resources they need to make their biggest dreams come true.","Peru is ranked 136th out of 140 countries in Quality of Primary Education and 137th of 140 countries in Quality of Math and Science (Global Report Competitiveness, 2015 World Economic Forum). Ventanilla is one of the most impoverished communities in Peru, with 65% of its population living in extreme poverty, on less than $150 per month for an average family size of 5; and only 1 out of 3 children finish secondary school. &nbsp; Kantaya is a non-profit organization that, for the past 12 years, has been helping the children of Ventanilla improve their education through after-school reinforcement centers called “Casita Feliz” (Happy House), where they feel safe and that they belong. This after-school program follows a curricula developed by educational experts, with the goal to close the gap by offering these children equal opportunities. Every month, 300 children between the ages of 5 and 15 attend the “Casita Feliz” centers after school, to receive a quality education and further strengthen their trust and self-confidence through values and creativity. &nbsp; Thanks to Kantaya, the children of Ventanilla have significantly improved their reading comprehension (from 12% to 83%) and math skills (from 12% up to 85%). Furthermore, while the majority of children come to the center with little desire to pursue long-term education, 90% of the children who enter the program see themselves pursuing higher education thereafter. The program has already enriched the lives of many children who, on their own, would not have been prepared to face post-secondary education. In Kantaya 67% are attending to a university or college against 2% in Ventanilla. &nbsp; The money raised will go to learning material for the “Casita Feliz” after-school reinforcement centers: &#8211; US$10 1 book for a child for a month &#8211; US$60 6 books for a child for a semester &#8211; US$120 12 book for a child for a year &#8211; US$240 24 book for 2 children for a year &#8211; US$480 48 books for 4 children for a year &#8211; US$960 96 books for 8 children for a year &nbsp; Thank you for helping us Ventanilla&#8217;s children&#8217;s dreams to reality.

Create a scholarship fund for young indigenous people of the highlands of Chiapas who have no resources to continue their high school and college studies. What is the opportunity or problem being confronted? Why is it important? Young people in the region do not have economic opportunities (or schools near their communities) that allow them to study in high school and college. The monthly family income ranges between 20 and 50 dollars, which for an indigenous family makes it almost impossible to send a person to study outside the community as it involves transportation costs, housing, food, and school supplies, among others cost. How will you achieve the goal? The donation, with the support of HipGive, will support the scholarship fund which gives a monthly grant to the young people involved in organizational processes for a dignified life and fair, just migration. In addition to the scholarships, we support with computer equipment if the students should require their use for homework, and we do monthly monitoring of their achievements and setbacks in the educational process, in addition to counseling if required. How will the donor&#8217;s contribution impact the success of the project? The impact is fundamental, because without this we could not afford the monthly expenses of the scholarships and it would be difficult for young scholars to be able to continue their educational processes.","We walk with the indigenous peoples of the highlands de Chiapas, a region historically excluded in many ways, the possibilities of access to a dignified life are reduced so the choice for hundreds of people is to migrate. Despite that, the young indigenous people stay motivated to continue studying because they see education as a right that contributes to the collective construction of better futures. When we study the world opens, we learn from others, share experiences and claim our rights, and with them we have more tools to contribute to the construction of a dignified life for our peoples. We want to contribute to the transformation of unjust realities of the region of the highlands de Chiapas. To study, learn, and share in educational spaces allows the young people to dream of better futures in which they value themselves in order to make way for the construction of a dignified life. Young people have the right to study, but the material conditions often override this right. Therefore, we believe that it is necessary to help to the right to education so that it does not remain an unfulfilled ideal, we want to make it a reality. It matters because we walk with hope and with firm dreams that life is worth living with dignity and rights.","Average annual scholarships for each student: $600 USD Annual average for scholarship fund for 20 students: $12,000 USD &nbsp; Becas anuales por cada estudiante en promedio: 600 USD Fondo de becas para 20 estudiantes en promedio anual: 12,000 usd",,,ended,20161118.0,@vm_apm,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFVz3e6JNoI&#038;feature=youtu.be

The Academy is composed of 100+ mostly lower income Latino high school students who have big dreams for their themselves and their community.

Though many of our students have experienced major challenges in their lives, such as growing up in a low-income, high density, high crime community (Salinas has the highest youth murder rate per capita in California) they are determined not to let their circumstances define their lives or determine the heights to which they can aspire in life.

National studies demonstrate that children whose parents engage in their school career perform far better than students whose parents lack this type of engagement. The majority of students LAWA serves in grades K-5 are underperforming academically.&nbsp;Most students lack parent support at home and parent school participation and families do not have access to a computer or internet at home. The&nbsp;challenges for many Latino families are exacerbated by parents&#8217; limited formal education, lack of the English language knowledge, poverty, and often, immigrant status. Their lack of exposure to pre-school programs and poor language development results in early age deficiencies in comprehension and reading skills. There is little or no support at home and students fall behind during their basic academic years. By leveraging&nbsp;LAWA’s Latino tutoring and parent&nbsp;involvement&nbsp;programs, we see a great opportunity to increase access to technology and computer skills for Latino families. Ultimately, families will be empowered with knowledge and tools to better support their children’s development. Why is it important? The internet has become a powerful educational tool in the last two decades. Children around the world are using the internet&nbsp;as their main source of information when they do homework, studying, academic research, and connecting with school. Many Latino students living in high-poverty areas have no internet access. On the other hand, parent engagement in their children’s academic lives is crucial to improve their academic achievement. Providing basic computer literacy, having a computer at home, and internet access will allow parents to engage more in their children’s life. How do you plan to accomplish your goal? Participating families in the current LAWA parenting program Padres y Líderes will receive computer literacy training, computers, and internet services for home. Padres y Lideres program offers 18-hour workshops using a curriculum that includes in-depth information about the school system, American culture, parent roles and responsibilities, and parenting tips. We plan to add computer literacy classes as part of the program. Once parents complete the workshops they will be provided a computer and discounted internet services. How will people’s support make an impact in the success of the project? People across the country will send donations from $5 to $30 to support this program. In addition to using the HIP platform, LAWA will use social media to promote the project as well as local radio station promotions to mobilize local people. We will also promote the project using e-mail marketing campaigns. We plan to use the Giving Tuesday opportunity to leverage promotion. With people’s donations and partnerships, we will be able to secure the purchase of &nbsp;250 computers and internet services. We will be connecting families to the world, to the school, and to the classroom.",,"LAWA PROJECT BUDGET 2016 &#8211; HIP GIVE Connecting Latino Families to the Classroom Expenses Computers: desktops, laptops, or pads $30 each x 135 units.

ConectArte youth programme acts to provide youth with the necessary tools to rebuild and strengthen their self-esteem, helping them positively affect their futures. The project aims to do so in four ways: 1)Equip youth with skills to develop life plans which include further education and/or job training and placement. 2)Promote youth empowerment and participation in the construction of healthy communities through the revitalization of public spaces and their transformation into spaces for community coexistence. 3)Contribute towards the creation of a better country image at the international level. 4)Strengthen capacity building of institutions and local artists to use street art as a medium for positive change in society. ConectArte targets youth between 18 and 26 years of age, who graduated from high school, but did not continue with higher education studies and are unable to find a job, live in precarious urban neighborhoods and therefore are affected by high levels of violence, poverty and the stigma associated with their communities. To initiate and launch the project, an inaugural workshop was held from April 25th to 29th, in collaboration with the Municipality of San Salvador and La Casa Tomada.The workshop included the participation of six highly regarded international artists – Ethos and Sergio (Brazil), MRtoll and Vexta (Australia), Lunar New Year (Ecuador) and Paola Delfin (Mexico)",,,,,publish,,,

Believing survivors without blaming them is key to helping survivors. Talking about sexual assault is key to stopping it! Many Spanish speaking immigrants do not know that what has happened to them was sexual assault or that there are options available to help them. The Promotoras work to educate community members about what sexual violence is- including sexual abuse in childhood, adult sexual assault, and sexual harrassment, about enthusiastic consent, about rights survivors have and about options for healing through Casa Fortaleza&#8217;s therapeutic program.

To have Spanish spekaing community members in their communities talking with people about what sexual assault is, what consent is, and about survivors&#8217; rights, is necessary to reach survivors who need and want services.

We are holding this crowdfunding campaign to raise funds for our current College Preparation program and expand our College Transition program. GIMD’s current college preparation program, Mi Avenida, supports girls in Denver’s urban corridors to: 1) develop long-term educational goals, 2) explore and prepare for post-secondary education, 3) prepare for college entrance exams, 4) submit college applications, 5) research and apply for college scholarships, 6) apply for financial aid, and 7) participate in career exploration activities. Our College Transition program addresses the significant hurdles faced by Latina students when entering college, especially those that identify as low-income and/or first generation college students. We hope to expand this program in 2016 by visiting accepted schools with students and participating in college orientation sessions, and providing direct individual support and guidance through the summer (ensure deadlines are met, address key barriers such as financial aid, etc.) College can be scary for first generation college students, and their families. GIMD plans to alleviate any fears by engaging with parents and families, using GIMD alumni as peer mentors for incoming freshman, and throwing college “showers” for girls who will live on campus. While a college “shower” may offset the cost of purchasing bed sheets or notebooks for college, GIMD also plans to assist with financial needs by identifying academic and financial aid advisors and other campus resources.","The late Nelson Mandela said, “Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.” Girls Inc. of Metro Denver agrees with Mr. Mandela and, therefore, encourages all girls to attend college with our College Preparation and College Transition programs. According to the Center for American Progress, Latinas hold only 7.4 percent of the college degrees earned by women in the United States, though they constituted 16 percent of the female population in 2012. This figure is only one reason why programs like ours are so important. We recognize the challenges that many of our girls face as they prepare for and transition into college as low-income and first-generation students. Our College Preparation and College Transition programs help girls and their families navigate barriers to enrollment and develop a resource-rich network that will lead them not just into college, but to graduation. We hope that our programs have the potential to impact the success of Latina students across the Denver metro area and state for years to come, as well as serve as a model for other underrepresented communities to create pathways to college. GIMD will measure the success of our programs by tracking: the number of girls served in our college preparation workshops, the number of girls receiving personalized case management support, the number of girls who attended college campus visits, and the number of parents who are engaged in college preparation and college transition programs.","The budget for the College Prep and Transition program includes: Salaries for Staff: $80,000 Summer Interns Stipends:$3,000 (for 2) College Tour of Colorado Schools: $4,200 Guest Speakers/Facilitators: $3,550 Materials &amp; Supplies: $2,775 Special Events, Workshops, Trainings, Parent Events: $2,200 Non-Cash Incentives of Girls: $1,400 Total for Program (including Administrative Costs): $104,125 Total Budget for Girls Inc. of Metro Denver: $1,279,138",,"Girls Inc. of Metro Denver’s mission is to inspire all girls to be strong, smart and bold. Part of that mission is to ensure that girls value their education, graduate on-time from high school, transition to college, and explore a wide-range of future career opportunities. In 2015, GIMD was able to realize significant expansion in our College Preparation program, as well as implement new programming and services to support girls in their transition to college. To expand our College Preparation program, we developed partnerships with four school sites in the Denver metro area, implemented a structured mentoring program for high school girls, and all of our college preparation and pregnancy prevention workshops were filled to capacity! To help with college transition, and get girls excited about college, we held a successful statewide college tour of Colorado during spring break and helped to launch the college shower: “Ready, Set, College!” To specifically assist first-generation college students, we launched case management services for high school juniors and seniors as well as home visits for girls and their families. In 2015, GIMD also developed a new college transition curriculum and identified other community resources for girls and families.

Many students are struggling and are at-risk in the Hispanic communities. We are working to ensure that every possible opportunity is offered for these students to succeed. This year we are also raising money to buy the children a brand new toy to open up on Christmas morning. It is heartbreaking to hear that the students usually receive a used toy, if receiving a toy at all. Children Within Our Borders is working hard to ensure that every child receives a proper education and a new present this year.","Children Beyond Our Borders (CBOB) is requesting $5000 to provide one year of our Children Within Our Borders&#8217; (CWOB) program weekly tutoring sessions and monthly educational workshops to three different cities, Orlando, Gainesville and Tallahassee. In Gainesville, we serve children of migrant workers between the ages of 4-14 years old in Alachua county. The facility has allowed our program to use their activity room free of charge. Tutoring will take place once a week for one hour, while workshops will take place once a month and last four hours. Tutoring will allow volunteers from the University of Florida and East Side High School to give students targeted homework and coursework help. Workshops will cover a variety of topics from personal health to success in education. The requested amount will cover basic supplies such as paper, pencils, crayons, and snacks as well as special materials to facilitate specific workshops. It will also help fund lunch for children and volunteers in attendance. Studies have proven that children living in poverty and homelessness are more than to likely demonstrate low academic scores, lack of health acknowledgement, and minimal life-skills. According to statistics 14.2 % of children in Central Florida live in poverty. CWOB in Orlando positively combats poverty and mentoring by providing educational workshops for children and teens living on Orange Blossom Trail at the Great Value Suites. Children who lack an unstable home are more susceptible to difficulties throughout their schooling career. High illiteracy rates, an absence of reading comprehension skills, and low test scores are only a few results of home instability. CWOB strives to create an environment conducive to learning for children. In CWOB in Tallahassee, our partnership with the Big Bend allows our organization to read to children ensuring that they are developing and improving reading comprehension skills on a weekly basis, providing them an opportunity to apply their skills hands-on in school. The Children Within Our Borders program intervenes to help children overcome adversity by giving them the support and educational tools necessary for long term success. In our first year of programming, our students have shown significant academic improvement. For example, a student came into our program after repeating the first grade twice, but after intensive volunteer tutoring and workshops, her grades began to improve. At the end of the year, she passed second grade and is now on her way to third. In addition, our workshops respond to critical needs. Past successful workshops include a dental hygiene workshop and a career day.",,,,ended,,IAMCBOB,

A donation today will help us double our efforts to provide scholarships for Latino leaders who want to attend our hunger and elections training in Washington, D.C.

Fernando Tamara, shares below &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212; As a Peruvian immigrant pastor, I never imagined that my voice would matter to members of Congress in the United States. As immigrants, we come to this country in search of opportunity but also with a lack of understanding about how the U.S. government works. Little or nothing happens when citizens in Latin America speak truth to power. But that’s different here. God has called me to journey alongside people through their lives’ challenges. Growing up in one of the poorest villages at the outskirts of Lima, Peru, I learned to subsist with just enough and to exercise the real meaning of hope. It was hard to understand and accept the extent of socio-economic disparity, but it made me look at root causes to economic inequality and to seek a solution: advocacy. Since coming to California from Peru in 1993, I have discovered that advocacy reflects my faith, which has allowed me to help the people I serve to champion pressing issues in our communities. Advocacy is necessary in the world we live because if we don’t do it, nobody will do it for us. It is not an option anymore; it is a mandate. Our job is not only defying the current, traditional arguments and policy prescriptions that hinder our communities, but also to create our own narrative of justice for Latinos in America. I have benefited from working with Bread for the World. As a result of Bread’s advocacy training programs, my life is stronger. In my ministry I have found my voice in being a strong and effective advocate for an end to hunger in this country. Today, I invite you to invest in faith and community-based leaders who want to learn more about how to elevate the hunger issue during this election. Your generous donation will equip Latino leaders to find their voice to speak truth to power and stand up for the rights and opportunities for the future of our communities. This is our time. &#8211;Rev. Fernando Tamara, Bread for the World activist.","At Bread for the World, we work and pray for a world free of hunger, where our children will have food and where their parents don’t need to skip meals to feed their children. Food pantries and soup kitchens are important in providing for people’s immediate needs. But they can’t end hunger on their own. The federal government has an important role to play. Only the U.S. government has the resources and power to change the systems and policies that allow hunger to persist. The Latino community in the United States is more vulnerable to hunger due to high unemployment, underemployment, low wages and for some, immigration status. A lack of access to higher education often perpetuates the impact of hunger and poverty across generations. It is estimated that 24% of Latino households, 30% of households with an undocumented head of household, and 40.4% of woman-headed households in the U.S. live below the poverty line. These are riveting facts that leave us painfully aware that people are going hungry in our own neighborhoods. Ending hunger is possible, but we must work together&#8211;juntos&#8211;to summon the public and political will to do so. It takes advocates—everyday people—to push their elected officials to make the government step up and do its part to end hunger. Your support means that we can train advocates with the skills they need use their voice, like Rev. Fernando Tamara, who knows that unless we get to the root causes of hunger and poverty, we will never see the gains we seek. This year’s elections will determine our country’s priorities for years to come – the next Congress and the new president must put solving the hunger problem at the top of their agenda if we are to make real gains. Hunger impacts all Latinos&#8211;indeed all Americans&#8211;and we must all do our part.","As an organization, Bread is devoting close to $10,000 to scholarship faith and community based leaders for training and educational purposes, from that we will allocate half for Latino leaders. Bread&#8217;s annual budget is around 12 million dollars.",,"Bread for the World is a collective voice urging our nation’s decision makers to end hunger at home and abroad.

Embarking on a dangerous journey&nbsp;through Mexico&nbsp;(many of them unaccompanied by an adult) they arrived at the US border. They were at some point picked up by Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency (ICE) and incarcerated at the U.S. detention centers. Soon after, they were sent to Refugee Centers until they were finally released to their parents/legal guardians.&nbsp;However, their hopes and dreams of starting a new life free from violence has been challenged during a complex transition and integration process- for many this has meant reuniting with family members they had not met before or seen in over a decade, attending new schools where they didn’t know anyone or speak the same language. &nbsp;Some are coping with isolation, anxiety, depression, and PSTD.&nbsp;Unfortunately, most of the neighborhoods where they live lack the proper support systems to help them adequately adjust. &nbsp;Organizations in Los Angeles like CARECEN and St. John’s Well Child &amp; Family Center and others have stepped forward to provide help for many of the young peoples’ trauma or through legal assistance for their&nbsp;immigration process.&nbsp;Homies Unidos is helping youth with the culture shock they are experiencing in their schools, communities and in their homes. Homies Unidos started reaching out to schools and community service providers to in hopes of reaching youth who may be in need mental health or legal services. As part of a preventive strategy we began implementing the “Joven Noble”, a personal/leadership development program which provides a safe space where participants can express themselves through indigenous traditional teaching tools. Despite limited resources, we have served over 58 youth in four different schools: Santee High, Hawthorne High, Hawkins High and L.A. River.&nbsp;This Conference will expose youth from other schools with these services, meet other youth in similar situations and be introduced to health service providers and other resources.Finally, we need to ensure these youths have a successful, healthy, safe, and well-supported integration to our communities.&nbsp;&nbsp;The main goals of the Conference are to:1. Reaffirm our support for and commitment to Central American youth and their families who fled violence and economic hardship in their country of origin and are now refugees in the U.S.2. Connect Central American youth with resources- legal, mental health, education and violence prevention services provided by trusted community organization.3.

On-site services include case management, life skills training, trauma counseling, and regular financial coaching. Residents also have access to academic counseling and tutoring provided through the college. In the two years since the program began residents of ARC&#8217;s housing program have completed nearly 200 community college credits and 100 four-year university credits.

This project aims to reduce the exposure of Loíza youth to the criminal justice system, to promote healthy and supportive school environments, and to encourage mental, emotional, physical, and social health for the boys and men of the community. The primary population of the project is Afro-Puerto Rican children and youth in this municipality. Of the entire Loíza population, 64% identify a black of Afro-Puerto Rican, 47% of these are men, and 29% are under 18 years of age. Believing that the methodology of the project should be ‘community-centric’, the Foundation convened a Community Commission to design the project’s strategic plan and lead its implementation.. The Commission’s members represent the community integrating leading nonprofits in the area, representatives of the public sector, as well as school administrators, teachers, parents and students. An important part of the plan is to empower a discussion on the perceptions and definitions of culture, ‘blackness’, and inequality, in order to create a common discourse that will be beneficial for addressing the structural inequality issues faced by the community. The Foundation is committed in facilitating the empowerment of the community to develop and implement this project adequately. The knowledge and experience acquired from this process will help us replicate this model in other parts of the Island. By donating to this project you would support the implementation of Phase Two, which consists of making small grants to the local nonprofits for the strategic initiatives that were presented in the plan, and for a scholarship fund that would aid this population in continuing their education.",,,,,ended,,,

This is the situation of more than 3,000 adults and children living in temporary camps in make-shift Anse-á-Pitres, a Haitian commune in the border crossing with the Dominican Republic. The unfolding humanitarian crisis is affecting mostly Haitian migrants or Dominicans of Haitian descent, who by force or fear, have left the Dominican Republic after a Constitutional Court ruling that conveys citizenship on the basis of parents’ immigration status. This law denationalized people that were even born on Dominican soil, speak Spanish -not French or Creole-, and know next to nothing about Haiti, in spite of being of Haitian descent. The families scattered across the southwest border, lack access to safe water, food or toilets and are facing a rapid spreading of cholera.

This has affected at least 138,000 people who are: Dominicans of foreign descent (the majority of whom are of Haitian descent) who were born in the DR, and whose parents (or in some cases, grandparents and great grand parents) were undocumented foreigners. Haitian migrants who were born outside of the Dominican Republic, but who immigrated in search of a better life in the DR without documented status. They are likely not registered as citizens of Haiti. These people are now stateless. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNCHR), a stateless person is someone who is not recognized as a national of any country. Nationality provides people with a sense of identity and belonging, and is important for full State protection and the exertion of human rights including education, healthcare, formal employment, property ownership, political participation and freedom of movement. The right to nationality is recognized in Article 15 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as well as in a number of widely ratified human rights treaties. Statelessness affects at least 10 million people around the world. Over a third of the world´s more than 10 million stateless people are children. Civil society organizations monitoring the issue in the Dominican Republic state that people are reporting fleeing out of fear of violence, threats and loss of property, and by official and unlawful deportation. Experts agree there are other additional human development factors that can arise due to the crisis along the Haiti-Dominican republic border, including: High rates of school dropout High rates of unemployment Lack of access to social security, pensions, and adequate healthcare Intrafamiliar violence (sexual violence, human trafficking, sexual exploitation) Family and social deterioration (separations of family) Depression, psychological crises, high numbers of suicide in affected population Condemnation to lives of poverty A continued cycle of alienation and marginalization down generation as statelessness is often passed down from parent to child There is an urgent and time-sensitive need to respond to this humanitarian crisis in the makeshift camps along the border and provide direct services to ensure the livelihoods, unity, and safety of thousands of people.",&#8211;,,"The Haiti Development Institute, formerly The Haiti Fund at the Boston Foundation, was born from the Boston community’s response to the earthquake of January 2010.

Also, you will help us provide medical supplies used during procedures to place and clean catheters. Join us in battle! Check out our themed donation levels. Why it matters? Cancer creates an instant sense of despair within the patients&#8217; families. In addition to it, the physical and psychological pain associated to its treatment also adds up to the complexity of facing this disease. By providing our patients with catheters, we will offer them a less painful care, allowing nurses to easily draw blood samples, administer medications, and chemoterapies. In the long run, catheters will reduce children’s traumas, and have a longterm positive effect on their emotional and physical wellbeing. Your donation will transform the lives of Guatemalan children with cancer. Our goals are: To provide catheters to at least 30 Guatemalan children with cancer. Buy medical supplies used during procedures to place and clean catheters. Every donation we receive will make a huge difference in the lives of our patients. Catheters will make children&#8217;s treatments less painful and more tolerable. In turn, you will receive a beautiful digital thank you card decorated by one of our patients! AYUVI (Fundación Ayúdame a Vivir) strives to offer Guatemalan children with cancer the best opportunity to be cured. To do so, it fundraises and provides all required resources for the operation, maintenance and growth of the National Pediatric Oncology Hospital -UNOP- , the only hospital in Guatemala specialized in childhood cancer. Our comprehensive treatment and all medical care are provided FREE OF CHARGE for all our patients. Some of the services we offer include: hospitalization, medicines, psychological and nutritional counseling, transportation stipends, lodging for families, and hospice care. Thanks to the support we have received from people like you, AYUVI has made a difference in the lives of Guatemalan children and their families. 6,900 children attended. 5,290 diagnosed with cancer. 2,402 children are free from the disease. The treatment abandonment rate decreased from 43% to under 1% from 2000 to 2015. Survival rates increased from 20% to 70% on average from 2000 to 2007. &nbsp; If you would like to learn more about our work please visit: www.ayuvi.org.gt",,,,,ended,20161121.0,FundacionAYUVI,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZIHo49xXUg

Rosa was forced to marry at age 15 by her family. With an abusive husband, she suffered many years during her marriage, and was denied a say in family or household decisions. Eventually able to separate from her husband, she faced many challenges raising her four children alone, often not knowing how she would afford to feed them and send them to school each month. With support from her former father in law, Rosa returned to school and decided to study nursing. Throughout her studies, Rosa realized she knew very little about her personal health, never mind her reproductive health. She began to think about how she lost her mother and aunt to cervical cancer as a young child. Rosa was terrified she would face the same fate. So she decided to seek a cervical cancer screening with WINGS, where our team discovered abnormal cell growth. If left untreated, those cells would likely have developed into cervical cancer. However, Rosa received on the spot cryotherapy treatment, and that day went home cervical cancer free. Rosa soon after joined the WINGS team as an assistant nurse. “I am grateful to WINGS for supporting me and allowing me to keep being a mother to my children. I am so proud to be able to help people in need. I love every part of my job; giving educational talks to communities in my native Mayan language, providing birth control methods, and screening women to prevent cervical cancer. This work is so important and I hope that I can do it forever.&#8221; Cervical Cancer is the #1 cancer-related killer of women in Guatemala, yet it&#8217;s the one CANCER WE CAN STOP! Currently 5.41 million Guatemalan women are at risk for developing cervical cancer. Cervical cancer is easily treatable when detected early. No one should die from this preventable disease. Yet 50% of Guatemalan women have never been screened. Help us send our Mobile Units to reach these women with a cervical cancer screening that could save their lives. 1 screening costs just $10. Why it matters? Through providing both cervical cancer information and prevention services, we aim to reduce the shocking number of unnecessary deaths of Guatemalan women caused by this preventable disease. When detected at an early stage, cervical cancer is highly treatable. However, in Guatemala the lack of education and limited health services mean that women, particularly in rural, disadvantaged areas, don’t realize they may be at risk and only seek help when it is already too late. &nbsp; A small donation of just $10 allows us to provide cervical cancer screening to one women with same-day results; this is crucial as women in rural settings, relying on mobile clinics for health services, are often unable to return or follow up on their procedures. If precancerous cells are detected during the screening, we proceed with same-day cryotherapy treatment. In the case of a more advanced lesion being detected, we refer the patient to a hospital making sure she receives the correct treatment. &nbsp; YOUR IMPACT Every $10 donated to this campaign will allow us provide a vital cervical cancer screening to one rural, at risk woman in Guatemala. If we reach our $5,000 goal this Giving Tuesday, we will be able to reach 500 women with this life-saving procedure. In case we don&#8217;t reach the entire goal, we will still use every dollar raised to provide cervical cancer screenings to as many women as we can! No matter how much you are able to give, you are helping this cause. Is there something you could give up this month in order to give back? How about that $5 pumpkin spice latte or caramel macchiato or whatever your favorite flavor is? It doesn&#8217;t have to be huge. Every little bit helps. Together, we can create change.

Don Mariano, originario de Chinameca en San Miguel, ha trabajado desde hace 14 años construyendo viviendas de láminas para familias de escasos recursos en el oriente del país. A pesar de haber crecido en pobreza y haber visto el futuro incierto en más de alguna ocasión, Don Mariano jamás abandonó su Fe en Dios llevándolo a entender que su propósito en la vida era obrar por los más necesitados. “Cuando escuché a Madre Teresa de Calcuta decir: La Caridad es Universal, sentí que esas palabras Dios me las regalaba a mí y así fue como inicié mi obra. Y desde que comenzó, ha beneficiado a más de 200 familias con una vivienda. Cada vivienda tiene un costo de $1,300. ¿Por qué es importante? Lamentablemente las condiciones bajo las cuales viven los más pobres en nuestro país son precarias. Hay muchas familias que no tienen un techo digno para vivir y esto desencadena sucesos traumáticos en la vida familiar de estas personas. Una vivienda más digna les ayudaría a estas familias transformar sus vidas sintiendo seguridad al contar con un techo seguro así como también para recuperar su autoestima y apoyarles en resolverles su triste situación. Don Mariano tiene muchas familias a quien quiere ayudar. El comenzó su obra con pocos recursos económicos pero con un enorme deseo y voluntad de querer hacer una diferencia significativa en las vidas de estas familias. Nos ha dado una lección de vida demostrándonos con hechos que ni la situación, origen ni edad es un impedimento para ayudar. Así que te pedimos a ti que dones a esta noble causa y ayudes a Don Mariano a multiplicar su obra tocando más vidas. ¿Cómo se usarán los fondos? Tu donativo irá dirigido a cubrir los gastos de construcción para 3 viviendas para igual número de familias. Toda la mano de obra es el aporte de Don Mariano, su familia, sus empleados y la comunidad lo que incide en el costo bajo de la vivienda.

In Morelos, violence hangs over the bodies of women and is increased by the failed policies of insecurity in recent years. It becomes a threat to the physical integrity and the ability of women to exercise their freedom. What is the objective of the project? 1-.Promote the rights of women in the apparel industry factories to prevent violent situations that may affect them because they are women. What is the opportunity or problem? 2. Women who work in the garment industry live different violations of their human labor rights such as wage inequality, discrimination for being a woman and if you are indigenous women this escalates more. They are physically and psychologically abused, are discriminated against occupationally, and if they are pregnant, they are not hired. Women experience sexual harassment by peers and immediate supervisors, which are promised higher wages and other jobs if they agree to their sexual propositions. Some workers are brave enough to report this violence, but the majority remain in silence because it&#8217;s unlikely anyone will believe them when they report. They ask the, &#8220;are you sure you want to report?&#8221; &#8220;Are you sure you&#8217;re not misinterpreting your supervisor&#8217;s kindness?&#8221; Or, &#8220;was it because of they way you were dressed?&#8221; These terribly sexist and macho comments put women in an even more vulnerable situation, making them believe they provoked the sexual harassment.","Given this gender-based violence experienced by women workers in the apparel industry factories, for Centro de Apoyo al Trabajador its important to promote human rights education with a clear gender perspective so that women workers can identify and report all forms of violence. Our intention is to accompany women in this process so that they increase their participation and leadership to prevent and eradicate violence. We believe that if these women are empowered to report the violence they face in various environments, they can advance with their rights and hopefully with time, we won&#8217;t have to hear about women being humiliated, violated or insulted. We hope that in this process, we can close the gap with men who are conscientious and open to walk alongside women in the fight for women&#8217;s rights and a life free of violence. &nbsp;","&nbsp; Presupuesto 2016 Centro de Apoyo al Trabajad@r A.C.

The CAT has accompanied educational processes with the workers of the auto parts industry and garment industry in the State of Puebla and Tlaxcala.

In these first contacts we got information about the workplace and the level of knowledge of DHL. The home visits, gives us their stories of life and work, where the workers talk about their working conditions, and receive from CAT verbal and written information about DHL and new contacts are obtained through their families, friends, neighbors. The educational process is the result of the concerns of the workers, it is intended that these processes are carried out in communities or in the colonies where they live to make another circle of trust. The work of CAT is based on the idea that ""every action has a reaction"" when the workers know and recognize their DHL, they automatically become concerned about the defense of these rights in the workplace. CAT has expressed solidarity with workers who have decided to exercise one specific DHL, ""freedom of association"". This work has been done through training, organization, coordination with other actors and reporting at national and international levels. We are currently working with the coalition of the workers formed in an alternating collision to defend their DHL, we know the reality that these workers live, we documented the specific labor rights of workers and violations. We believe that one way to tackle the problem and gender violence in the maquila is training, case documentation and especially the organization of the workers so that together, knowing their labor rights and the types of violence will be able to defend recovering their bargaining and mobilization.",ended,20160301.0,CATPUEBLA,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWT9teuWAik&#038;feature=youtu.be

As part of this effort we have convoke to the course Recuperation of Autonomous Sexuality – from repression to reconciliation with our bodies -. The course aims to create a space of security and affective network that contributes to the experience and reflection of women to develop sustainable tools for individual and collective healing, to regain an active role, knowledge, relationships and physical and sexual awareness. We want a high number of women to participate in this course, so we have started a fund for donation to provide 10 half- scholarships to Guatemalan women with economic difficulties.","&#8220;The most important and profound sexual relationship we have is with ourselves.&#8221; &nbsp; In Centro Q’anil we are interested in producing complex knowledge articulated to Holistic Feminism to explore and understand the cultural patterns apprehended and help heal wounds collectively. We want to research the body as a whole: physical, emotional, psychological, sexual, spiritual, socio-historical. Also, we are interested in contributing to broaden the knowledge about referring to sexuality from the integrality of human beings, not only regarding genitals. &nbsp; Since in Guatemala sexuality is most taboo subject, even among gender and feminism studies, Centro Q’anil proposes el course Recovery of the Autonomous Sexuality -from repression to reconciliation with our bodies- This course aims to focus the individual potential of every woman to recover and transform their stories focused on sexuality as an integral whole. This involves not to focus on violence, which places women statically in trauma and the role of victims, but to work sexualities from a vital and liberating potential. This course is consider an experiential process, toguether with some conceptual theoretical reflection, to undertake individual experiencies of transformation towards recovering the relationship with our bodies and our sexuality, being active protagonists in making decisions.

The cost of each session within this course is of Q400 quetzales ($50 dollars), which only covers the cost of the teachers per session. And while $50 does not seem to be much money for a two-day workshop, many Guatemalan women are not able to make this expenditure for an integral training space because of other basic needs. To support them, we want to make this fund and offer the support of half-scholarships. The cost of supporting one participant with a half-sholarship during 12 sessions is Q2400($ 300). &nbsp; With the gathering of $3000 we can offer 10 half-scholarships to participate in the full workshop, allowing a greater number of people with economic impossibilities, but high desire for personal growth, to recover their own history in relation to sexuality. &nbsp; Contact us Mail: sostenibilidadcreativa@sanacionqanil.org.gt Phone: (502) 24740374 https://www.facebook.com/sanacionqanil &nbsp;",,,,,ended,,,

Our goal is to provide Guatemalan youth with the knowledge and skill sets to access better jobs and opportunities in tech-related industries. How are we going to do this? By utilizing the knowledge, skills, resources, and network of our community to provide a training program for Guatemalan youth. We will engage the existing community of techies and entrepreneurs, and channel the collective skills and interests in training up Guatemalan youth to make them more employable in the tech sector better positioned to launch their own businesses service the broader community in innovative ways Why is it important? There are a lot of highly competent and resourceful youth in Guatemala that do not have access to education and opportunities for more high skilled and higher paid jobs. Resourceful youth that are graduating from high schools and struggling to find job opportunities oftentimes end up resigning themselves to low skills, low salary positions in the tourism industry. There are two problems: 1) there are not enough opportunities, and 2) many bright individuals are failing to fulfill their potential. In the Innovation Center, we will offer classes to develop skills sets that will provide Guatemalan youth more opportunities in the tech and industry sector, catalyze entrepreneurship and give the tools that will make them, along with their creativity, propose solutions to problems that being overlooked. We know of several tech companies that would like to establish in Antigua Guatemala, but lack of qualified people keeps them from entering. Through educating youth in topics and skills that are highly relevant and employable, we can also attract more tech related business to Antigua and thus open more employment opportunities for youth in this area. Antigua Innovation Center will not only teach them the knowledge and skill sets necessary for accessing better jobs, but also through our network and resources connect them with investors, potential partners, etc. ¿How will we measure our impact? We have the knowledge, human capital, community, network, and physical space ready for launching the project; all we need is the investment to build out and invest in the facilities for Antigua Innovation Center! By investing heavily in a high tech modern training center we will be able to offer classes that will unlock the potential in local youth in the ways described above. On a very lean budget we could roll this out in a bare bones facility, but with your support we can create something that all of Antigua can be proud of, stimulate aspirations for students, and more innovative and creative solutions. With your support we will be able to launch the Innovation Center before the end of this year. Milestones If we reach $10k: We will be able to equip the center with the bare minimum of supplies needed (such as desks, chairs, a projector, and a few computers) to start providing classes and workshops to local youth. If we reach $25k: We will be able to fully equip the learning facility with 20 computers, software, photo, video and media equipment to give classes and start innovative projects within a wide range of topics. If we reach $40k: We can have the best possible facility &#8211; equipped with the most high tech innovative equipment&nbsp;ready to catalyze innovation, startups, and entrepreneurship in Antigua. &nbsp;",,N/A &#8211; I can provide separate document.,,,ended,20160930.0,ImpactAntigua,https://youtu.be/9wpWkPOjK4k

A scholarship-based approach to transforming schools into local hubs for promoting Mayan girls’ right not to migrate in Chuatroj, Guatemala.","We dream of a Guatemala in which indigenous children and adolescents have the right not to migrate; that is, that conditions exist so that they can grow up healthy, educated, and carry out their dreams in the place where they were born. &nbsp;However, the poverty and lack of health services, education, and employment that characterize their communities force many families to migrate in order to survive; girls and young women increasingly migrate unaccompanied. &nbsp;In Chuatroj, the Maya-K&#8217;iche &#8216;community where we work, 100% of the population lives in poverty and 75% of households have family members who have migrated. We believe that secondary school is a hub for promoting the right not to migrate. &nbsp;Our project seeks to achieve just that in Chuatroj. Despite evidence demonstrating the correlation between secondary education and improvements in social indicators in Guatemala, all secondary education is private; who cannot afford the cost of tuition and useful are left with a primary education. We collaborate with Chuatroj’s Scholarship Committee and the local Credit Union to administer a scholarship program designed to help the area’s most vulnerable students overcomes this obstacle.&nbsp; It also allows their families to diversify their spending on basic goods necessary to improving living conditions by diversify their families’ expenses. &nbsp;We provide a monthly financial support to cover 100% of their school fees and contribute to improved nutrition, hygiene, access to healthcare, and clothing. &nbsp;A percentage of the scholarship stays in a savings account for the student. &nbsp;The Committee carries out recreational activities with scholars to build self-esteem and encourage them to think that another future is possible, and we monitor their academic performance so that the necessary academic support can be provided. Last year our funding allowed us to provide scholarships to 10 of the 27 students identified for the program; eight of them are girls. &nbsp;It has secured funding to support follow during the current school year. &nbsp;Of the 17 students in our &#8220;waiting list,&#8221; 6 are orphan girls and adolescents. &nbsp;This campaign seeks funds to provide a scholarship for these 6 girls for the 2016 school year.","Our program&rsquo;s impact is two-fold.&nbsp; At the individual and family level: It targets girls and teenagers whose precarious economic and family and community situation makes them highly vulnerable to dropping out of school, child labor, early pregnancy and a lifetime of chronic illness, malnutrition, and extreme poverty.&nbsp; Our project cushions the impact of this situation on our students&rsquo; (and their families&rsquo;) future and mitigates the pressure to migrate by providing them this educational opportunity as well as a financial support that covers basic needs. It fosters a culture that prioritizes a child&rsquo;s right to schooling and involves parents in their child&rsquo;s academic success.&nbsp; This is especially important in Guatemala where indigenous girls are systematically excluded from schooling due to cultural beliefs about traditional gender roles and the right of women to study. It allows impoverished families to gain experience administering a regular income and introduces a saving mentality.&nbsp; As many of our families are single-mother homes, our project contributes to improved financial literacy and autonomy among women. It is raising elementary (and soon secondary) school completion rates amongst Mayan children; It has the potential to increase the number of Mayan youth who pursue a university degree; It has the potential to increase the number of Mayan&rsquo; children who have access to healthcare during their critical growth period. At the community level: It contributes to building a self-sufficient, healthy village in the absence of a support from the central government; It is strengthening local capacities to collectively propose, implement, and administer projects directed at fomenting self-sufficiency and improving quality of life. We have established a quantitative baseline for scholars currently in the program, which allows us to measure improvements in grades and attendance over their course of their school career.&nbsp; We also conduct bi-annual evaluation meetings with Committee members and students to discuss students&rsquo; personal and academic progress and generate ideas for improving impact.&nbsp; We are currently defining measures for improving how we monitor living conditions and provide greater support for mothers.","TOTAL $21,831.00 Recursos humanos Coordinador del proyecto Asistente T&eacute;cnico Facilitadora Comunitario $9,733.00 Fondo de becas escolares Aporte economico mensual durante 12 meses&nbsp;para l@s 27 estudiantes identificados por el Comite de Becas de Chuatroj&nbsp;cuya situacion de alta vulnerabilidad social pone en riesgo su escolarizacion. $4,320.00 Aporte para la operaci&oacute;n comunitaria del Comit&eacute; de Becas en Chuatroj Tenemos un acuerdo de contrapartida con la Cooperativa local y los institutos educativos en el que se responsabilizan con un porcentaje alto de los gastos administrativos del proyecto en la comunidad- internet, tel&eacute;fono, impresi&oacute;n de documentos administrativos) $50.00 Materiales did&aacute;cticos Para la realizaci&oacute;n de actividades l&uacute;dicas y talleres con becarios, sus familias y miembros de Chuatroj El costo es mayor pero logramos donaciones &ldquo;in-kind&rdquo; para la mayor&iacute;a de los materiales $500.00 Comunicaci&oacute;n/Difusi&oacute;n Administraci&oacute;n de p&aacute;gina web Impresi&oacute;n de materiales de promoci&oacute;n PO Box en Estados Unidos $301.00 Equipo Alquiler de ca&ntilde;onera durante reuniones de evaluaci&oacute;n y monitoreo con el Comit&eacute; Local $189.00 Transporte Entre la sede de coordinaci&oacute;n en Ciudad de Guatemala y la sede del proyecto en Chuatroj, Totonicap&aacute;n para la realizaci&oacute;n de reuniones de evaluaci&oacute;n y monitoreo con el Comit&eacute; Local Viajes de fortalecimiento institucional y gesti&oacute;n de fondos en el exterior $1,980.00 Vi&aacute;ticos Alimentaci&oacute;n y hospedaje para miembros del equipo de Coordinaci&oacute;n de INCEDES para la realizaci&oacute;n de reuniones de evaluaci&oacute;n y monitoreo con el Comit&eacute; Local en Chuatroj $2,933.00 Administraci&oacute;n Aporte de 10% a la administraci&oacute;n de INCEDES $1,825.00",,"INCEDES was founded in Guatemala in 2005 by a group of Guatemalan researchers who studied regional migrations and the conditions that caused them.

Our mission is to strengthen society’s ability to address regional migrations as well as formulate and advocate for public and social policies that fully protect the rights of migrants and their families and encourage the right not to migrate. To do this, we have established four lines of work: 1) “Social Vulnerability and Development for the Migrant Family” Program: coordinates and supports processes in Mayan origin and destination communities that promote grass roots efforts to generate conditions that facilitate the right not to migrate. 2) “Applied Research Program”: conducts research on issues related to youth and labor migrations, the relationship between migration, development and human rights, remittances, and immigration legislation 3) “Education Program”: coordinates trainings with government officials and courses with international students and regarding migration and development 4) “Public Advocacy Program”: advocates and advices national and regional executive and legislative bodies on migration issues",ended,20160301.0,brighten_barrio,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9u9JcZJRTYk&#038;feature=youtu.be

We help to improve the quality of life for Afro-Colombian families by making an affordable program for language instruction and workforce readiness skills more accessible and ensuring that teachers are not just dedicated and skilled instructors, but also committed to uplifting the culture, heritage, and pride of Afro-Colombian people. For our families, literacy in both English and Spanish is a critical for college and career opportunities that can help provide a living wage. We also understand that self-confidence and a community support network helps people overcome even the most difficult circumstances. That’s why we help participants connect with each other AND utilize technology and face-to-face interaction with native English speakers of African descent as language partners. Participants have the incredible and rare opportunity to enjoy a foreign-language curriculum that celebrates Afro-Latin@ heritage and builds their network of support in Colombia and internationally. The problem our families are facing: Afro-Colombians who want to learn English, attend college, or find a job that pays a living wage often can’t do so for two main reasons: Class cost too much, with the high unemployment rates and a national minimum wage of approximately $ 234.41 USD per month our families often cannot afford much of the cost for training and preparation, and There are virtually no teachers or programs available in Afro-Colombian communities. How we help. Afro-Bilingüe helps solve this problem by creating curriculum, training teachers, and granting scholarships to students. Afro-Colombian teachers are front and center for developing the program and students have an opportunity to say what curriculum components are most relevant for them. This is a community-centered, community-led initiative that empowers Afro-Colombian families to take the lead in creating the change they know will be most useful for their children and community. How you can help? By donating to the Afro-Bilingüe program, you will help us train teachers, grant scholarships, and increase the earning potential for over 100 families.","Lack of opportunities to study at a higher level, leisure, shortage of employment, young people especially, deviate from their horizon and end up in crime, pregnancy, as school dropouts, and with low self-esteem. These conflicts progress in the lives of adults and end up destroying happiness for individuals, families, and the entire community. For Afro-Colombians, social issues like these, in terms of economy and social inclusion, reveal significant inequality for our community. Given these facts, and with the aim of fixing these issues by expanding access to opportunity, Afro-Bilingue was born. With your support, we can build unity and develop successful communities, families and children, with a high self-esteem based in the pride of being Afro-Colombian.","Organization&#8217;s Budget Size Angela Davis &#8211; $ 59,000,350 Colombian Pesos (COP) = $ 20,125.609 (USD) FUNDABAS &#8211; $ 99,800,000 Colombian Pesos (COP) = $ 34,042.778 (USD) Sub Total: $ 54,168.38 *Budget size does not include the following in-kind resources: FREE Professional Services from JAMII (December 1, 2015 – May 31, 2016) = $34,000 Volunteer Teachers/Administrative Support @ $ 250 per month USD = $ 2,500 Lodging from local partners = 2 homes available for guests to stay 30 – 60 days free of charge (% of rent, utilities, and food for guest) = approx. $500,000COP per month = $340.00 USD Sub Total In-Kind Resources = $36,840 GRAND TOTAL: $ 89, 680.38 ___________________________________________________ Overview of Program Budget The program is taking place in two sites: 1 in Buenaventura, Colombia &amp; 1 in Barranquilla, Colombia.

Serving young women 16 through 25 years of age, 7th Direction uses a collective impact approach, partnering with several community based organizations. This residential facility and transitional program will be coupled with a day/evening program which is open to community and self identifying indigenous woman. Collaborative partners will provide core individual, group, extension services, as well as innovative programming for this special female reentry cohort.

In fact, since 1977, the female prison population has surged 757 percent. When women offenders are released and return to their communities, they usually have no or limited support systems, including, program options, family support, educational or vocational services, housing, health care, and other vital resources. Most women that have been incarcerated are economically poor prior to incarceration, and especially after release. Research states that nearly 75% of female offenders are unmarried and 80% have at least one child under 10 years old. NM has a high rate of recidivism which is putting a strain on the state&#8217;s prison system. Along with all the other factors mentioned before, other issues are and become more severe due to incarceration particularly with women. These include post incarceration syndrome, mental and physical health, family issues, prenatal and postnatal care, risk of HIV and other infectious diseases. Prevention and treatment programming are critical and necessary for successful integration of our women and their families who deeply impacted in transition. Female inmates tend to be overlooked because they comprise a much smaller percentage of the general population than their male counterparts. However, since the female population has been steadily increasing, more attention is needed and should be focused on this group, especially in an effort to find effective and sustainable ways of keeping girls and women out of the prison system and from returning to prison. Extensive research has been done to help us to understand the major factors and challenges associated with crime, offenders, social systems and conditions that surround this environment. However, not enough is being done to resolve or even alleviate this severe issue impacting our community, families and children. Establishing collaborative partnerships among corrections, social services, treatment systems, and other established agencies with much needed services for this targeted population of women. Rehabilitation and reintegration is a long-term process which requires assessment for successful outcomes. Because rehabilitation is limited while people are in confinement, the responsibility of reformation is at the mercy of the post correctional supervision, community based programs, social support agencies, and treatment programs after release. Our program is tailored to assist young indigenous women who are in serious jeopardy of becoming homeless or re-institutionalized due to marginalization. The greatest structural barriers are housing and employment. The participants will receive trauma informed healing, individual counseling, mentoring and education that is often needed for successful reintegration. This may include healing circles, individual or group counseling, life skills, leadership development and job training. It is common for family fragmentation to exist when one is institutionalized, therefore important that participants receive support in mending family ties. Staff will work directly with courts, probation officers, social agencies, family and social networks which promotes personal development and family wellness, thereby healthier communities. For indigenous women, it is critical to provide spiritual and cultural support to strengthen efficacy and core identity, where in urban settings, native women have been exposed to childhood abuse, sexual violence, exploitation and disconnected to their ancestral tribal communities and traditional ways of living.","BUDGET PROPOSAL: 7th DIRECTION, CTI-R TRANSITIONAL PROGRAM (ANNUAL) CTI Case Manager (1) $40,000 Director / Clinical CTI Supervisor (1) $60,000 Development Specialist &amp; Fiscal Management $20,000 Farming, Social Enterprise, Art Therapy &#8211; Program Staff $20,000 Program/Resident Monitors (2) – Operations $30,000 CSA food boxes @ $375/season (weekly food boxes) $4,500 National CTI training (2 days) &amp; ongoing support $5,000 PIRE Evaluation $40,000 Program equipment and supplies (initial/startup computers, database software and ongoing facility and residential supplies) $20,000 Transportation – purchase new van to transport participants $35,000 Subtotal $274,500 Fiscal sponsorship fee or admin overhead (10%) $27,450 Total $301,950",,"La Plazita Institute, Inc. is a 501(c)(3) community organization using a comprehensive, holistic and cultural approach designed around the philosophy of “La Cultura Cura” or culture heals.

Lesbians in Mexico face a double process of discrimination and exclusion due to our sexual orientation and our women condition; that affects our vital experiences and endangers our full growth; it fractures our citizenship. One recurrent symptom of this situation is that we are not acknowledged nor recognized in social transformation movements. Therefore, despite the great efforts that both, the feminist movement and its claims on women’s rights, and the LGBTI movements in their fight for sexual liberty, we lesbians, live immersed in silence. Additionally, stereotypes about lesbians are commonly built, creating negative archetypes and invisibilizing the contributions that lesbians make to society. For this reason Closet de Sor Juana´s project #LesbiansInvolved: Advancing Change For Everyone, is an awareness campaign highlighting the many different areas where lesbians contribute to make this a better world for all of us; we want as many people as possible to learn about the work we do on a daily basis towards making this a free and democratic society, and help another lesbians to find positive role models and feel represented by women who share this identity.

We want to raise awareness of what is happening within the electronics companies so that women workers begin to talk about it and recognize sexual violence and that there are laws to protect them. Most people think if they speak up or complain they will be fired get harassed by others. With this campaign we aim to create awareness among the women workers; and with this knowledge empower them to speak up and not remain silent if there is sexual violence. Workers should denounce and not be silent. Silence means more women will continue to suffer. Among the most violated rights of workers are sexual harassment and workplace harassment which go hand in hand. The ILO defines sexual harassment as conduct based on sex, lewd and offensive to the sufferer. Sexual harassment is a hidden, little persecuted and almost never reported abuse which thousands of women workers suffer daily, causing a complicated emotional reaction. So much so that 6 of 10 women workers who face sexual harassment decide to quit rather than dealing with the nasty insinuations. One in four is fired because she does not respond to the sexual aggression. Sexual harassment is a problem that exists in all sectors of work, but within the electronic industry it is a very common scenario which is ignored by the companies. These kinds of cases are made invisible. There are no solutions offered for women who complain. Sexual harassment can occur in two ways: First, when victims are offered some kind of work benefit such as a raise, promotion or even keeping her job in return for sexual behavior. Second, within a hostile work environment which favors intimidation or humiliation. Women workers suffer harassment by their immediate superiors, (call supervisors, engineers, managers, etc.). The fact is that the majority of women working in production floors have experienced this kind of harassment or know a colleague who has suffered and who did not report. The main reason women do not report is for fear of being fired or because they don&#8217;t recognize the harassment for what it is. The situation is critical and there aren&#8217;t reliable statistics to measure the problem and the authorities have focused very little on addressing the problem. &nbsp; &nbsp;","It is important to elucidate the violence, we know today is an issue which causes great indignation the majority of the population are women, and although we know that many organizations and individuals are working to diminishes this problem, violent situations against women still occurs quite frequently. Within the maquiladoras in the electronics industry, in production floors most are women who work in lower-paid positions and where not many studies is required. Their living situation leads them to look for such jobs, which are used with few requirements and few benefits, what is really alarming is that over the working nobody cares, nobody looks at the situation in which they live trying to get by every day . The situation of a worker is complicated because in addition to working a minimum eight-hour day adding two hours available, to receive a salary that can not afford to pay for their survival as: electricity, water, rent, food your family, education of their children (oS), clothing, etc., also has to deal with labor problems, entry salary, which is not enough as already mentioned. Within these companies are exposed to certain abuses and violations of their rights are among the most common low pay, gender discrimination, sexual harassment, workplace harassment, ill treatment, lack of freedom of association, among others. It seems that these problems are very normal, and the seriousness of the situation is that the same workers are unaware of their rights and where to go for guidance. Sexual harassment is common and is distinguished by the same, plus they do not know how to deal with the problem when they feel uncomfortable, leading them to give up many times their work and sometimes they stay out of necessity and have to endure the labor harassment not access sexual favors. This makes workers increasingly work in inhumane situations and neither the company nor unions do nothing to bring solution, but that is just the opposite, they are more often participants in these violations. We hope that the workers aware of the problem of sexual harassment. Input they know distinguish and thus act against this practice that seems common in the homes of producing these maquiladoras. They realize that they are victims of sexual violence, they make the determination to denounce, to take action to improve their working environment and also that it may result in other aspects of his life, and in social and family. They educate their background hijxs and thus initiate a positive change for future generations of women and men. We hope that more allegations of sexual harassment within companies, as well as legal entities. They expect more women in counseling and take the workshop on gender-based violence, particularly sexual harassment. (Domestic workers) who will monitor complaints of sexual harassment within the companies they work, and the solutions given to such cases: monitors are created. We also expect themselves to sponsor this problem and help to ring and reach the ears of more partners to support one another. Make them aware that if one is beset other companions they are too. &nbsp;","Presupuesto campaña Material (trípticos, volantes, carteles, pegamento, cintas, etc.) distribución en 12 empresas de la industria electrónica, y 15 colonias populares. $14,700 Logística (transporte e insumos comestibles) para tres personas. $8,000 Talleres sobre acoso sexual (Tallerista, lugar, material didáctico, papelería, etc.) para 30 obreras (os). $15,500 Insumos (agua, galletas, café, etc.) para 30 obreras (os). $1,800 TOTAL: $40,000 &nbsp; Presupuesto general anual: Gastos de material oficina y talleres $58,000 Gastos de material de promocion (tripticos, volantes, folleteria) $25,000 Gastos de oficina/servicios $51,400 Gastos de promoción y difusion de la organizacion $15,000 Gastos de organización interna (asambleas ordinarias y extraordinarias) $11,000 Encuentro nacional de trabajadoxs $ 120,000 Apoyo a voluntarios (5 voluntarios) $ 68,960 &nbsp; TOTAL: $349,360",,"We are a coalition of a group of ex-workers (s) and women (s) of the Electronics Industry of different states, particularly Jalisco and the northern border.

Since 2014, we have been part of this effort with the girls of the women&#8217;s networks, since by studying it is possible to avoid forced marriages and maternity in the adolescents and young people of these communities. The young members of the Chuj-mayan female networks in Nentón, Huehuetenango study to make changes in their lives; their dreams are to study to be professionals and work for them, their families and their community; become midwives, engineers, writers, photographers, community authorities, nurses, any job that gives them resources for life and the sustainability of their community. In addition, many of these young people are the first to study their family, and this already in itself, is a change. Achieving these dreams means currently resources for the payment of their books, notebooks, transportation and lodging.

In the Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) region where traditional gender roles appear entrenched, health threats often fall to women and girls to provide care and other responsive solutions. This burden further undermines the ability of women and girls to progress and prosper. Out of the 140 million individuals lacking health care coverage in LAC, women are disproportionately affected, according to the World Bank. When women are not healthy, families and communities suffer. Therefore, PAHO Foundation fortifies the notion that women and society are likely to thrive in the areas of family, work, and community by prioritizing women’s health. Campaign Summary: PAHO Foundation&#8217;s “Women&#8217;s Health Is Public Health” campaign aims to bring greater attention to the challenges facing women and girls in Mexico and throughout the region. The campaign will allow the Foundation to generate resources and work with local partners to design projects aimed at increasing women and girls’ access to health care and better health delivery services. With your support, we can increase access to health care services, improve health education, provide financial resources, and bring equality to health care for women and girls in Mexico and throughout the region. About PAHO Foundation: PAHO Foundation (formerly the Pan American Health and Education Foundation – PAHEF) was established September 5, 1968, and since our inception, we have dedicated our work to advancing public health, health education, and equitable health care access in the Americas. The Foundation exists primarily to respond to existing and emerging health threats in the Americas. Together with our partners, we carry out work within three major areas of public health challenges: communicable diseases, non-communicable diseases, and health systems strengthening &#8211; including women&#8217;s health. With innovative partners, we identify and engage relevant stakeholders to develop programs, mobilize public and private sector resources, share knowledge, and convene and collaborate to improve the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work, and age – building healthier, more secure futures for families, communities, and countries across Latin America, the Caribbean, the United States, and Canada. PAHO Foundation espouses that given the relationship between women’s health and the broader impacts on the economy, including those on families, communities, and future generations, primary attention is called for to address the challenges impacting women’s health and wellness. The Foundation further believes that to address the health of women and girls is to address public health and thereby strengthen individuals, families, and communities in Mexico and throughout Latin America.",,"PAHO Foundation recognizes that to address women’s health is to address public health and therefore advances a platform to improve the health of women and girls in Mexico and throughout the Americas region. PAHO Foundation will leverage partners and local stakeholders already engaged in similar efforts to conduct a landscape assessment; build knowledge of the challenge; educate key stakeholders, including policy makers; and propose strategic interventions that can lead to measurable positive outcomes and impacts.

In the United States the Latino community has the highest number of people living without health insurance. It is our mission to promote social change and health equity in the Boulder community. Many Latino families in Boulder lack access to clean drinking water, healthy food, and opportunities to participate in recreational activities and this is a huge barrier to healthy living. Although Boulder boasts of a high quality of life for many of its residents, disparities exist among our community. Our Latino residents generally experience poorer overall health such as diabetes and obesity. Access to quality healthcare for mental and physical ailments results in a lower life expectancy. Lack of access to clean drinking water, healthy food, and opportunities to participate in recreational activities are barriers to health for many Latino families in Boulder. Our three major concerns within our community within Boulder county are Obesity, Diabetes, and Mental Health The &#8220;Promotoras de Salud&#8221; are leaders who are trained and deployed by AMISTAD to educate their peers about healthy living and promoting integral well-being. They are agents advocating for social change in favor of equity in health and a healthy lifestyle. The &#8220;Promotoras de Salud&#8221; are recognized by the community for their ability to provide information about health and integral well-being through meetings, group conversations and activities with the purpose of promoting a just, active and healthy community. Promotoras de Salud are trained community health workers who are prepared to take on many roles depending on the needs of the community. They are uniquely qualified to work within their communities to address health disparities by strengthening existing community ties and serving as liaisons between the health and social systems.

Junior Achievement Honduras is a non-profit foundation that implements extracurricular educational programs for children, teens, and women nationwide. Our passion is to inspire young people and women to learn how our economy works, what influence it has in their daily lives and how to use this knowledge to improve their quality of life. We also aim to teach the principles of business creation as a driver of social development and economic. &nbsp; HISTORY The Women Entrepreneurs project was set up a four years ago through our Junior Achievements organization. We seek to help women who are in the process of pre-release from the National Women&#8217;s Penitentiary, located in the municipality of Tamara in Francisco Morazán, Honduras. The penitentiary holds approximately 456 women, yet it is designed for only 200 women. This means it is severely overcrowded. So far, we have focused on training these women so they will be equipped to find long-term employment, in which our entrepreneurs receive training at no cost. But our aim is to beyond this and have a greater impact on these women’s lives. This campaign will benefit 14 women who are ready to be released by giving them seed capital which will allow them to develop their skillset to become entrepreneurs. As such, this campaign will benefit not only these women’s lives, but their communities as well. The primary objective of the campaign is thus to reintegrate these women as economically active citizens through their ventures, which may be set up during the duration of the program. We know these are high aims that are not easily achieved in a society in which gender discrimination is endemic. But precisely because it is endemic, these women require a supportive environment to give them voice and stimulate entrepreneurship, ideas, and freedom to develop. &nbsp; WHAT ARE WE TRYING TO ACHIEVE? How will the money raised in the campaign be allocated? We want to benefit 14 women who are at the stage of pre-release and have ventures developed through our programs, raising $ 8,500, which will serve as seed capital for the enterprises of these 14 women. The money will also be used to cover the costs of continued training and materials for up to eight months, this way they can have a dignified reintegration into society. Without such programs, it is well-known that ex-convicts face perpetual social discrimination and severe employment limitations. Their criminal background will be a continuous burden to carry, and without new opportunities will substantially diminish their quality of life. &nbsp; ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL IMPACT The reintegration of these 14 women in the pre-release stage through initial seed capital will allow them to develop their own ventures, contribute to society and the economy, as well as take responsibility for their own lives. Due to stigma of a criminal record, ex-convicts often suffer discrimination even after having served their judicial sentence. This often impedes them from future employment; which greatly increases the difficulty of rebuilding their own lives as well as recovering a sense of self-esteem. Our program will help not just through seed capital but also through continued support in the form of advice. This advice will enable them to build self-sustaining businesses that generate economic development for their community, municipality, and even the country. A stable business will also enable the participants to maintain their families, as most of them are single moms. The campaign will thus have a positive economic and social impact.

According to available information, in 2012, in Mexico there were 2.5 million people working as agricultural workers (ENOE, 2012 and the Population and Housing Census, 2010). This population shares certain characteristics, that are to say that they are the poorest people, who come from more precarious conditions. A large part of this workforce often includes of worker´s total families: women, girls, children, youth and workers of indigenous peoples being more vulnerable to abuse. Thanks to them (and unfortunately including the agricultural work of almost one million children), we can buy around 24/7 of different agricultural products from the supermarket. But in many cases, we do not think about where these products come from and under what living and working conditions of those who make it possible. We have a great opportunity to demand the responsibility of companies and the governments for the welfare and dignity of agricultural workers. Because they are indigenous, because they are women, men, girls, boys and youths, because they are migrants, it does not mean that they do not have rights. Help us to change this reality! Your contribution is just for that! Potential Challenges: The violence that exists in the different geographical areas where the agricultural ranches in Mexico are located. As well as it is important to emphasize that the violence in the origin communities migrant workers. The lack of information of companies to the workers in matter of labor rights in the agricultural fields.

La Corte Interamericana de Derechos Humanos ha señalado la ineficacia judicial frente a los casos de violencia contra las mujeres; lo anterior, propicia un ambiente de impunidad que facilita y promueve la repetición de los hechos. El poder judicial debería representar la primera línea de defensa y protección para los derechos y las libertades de las mujeres, sin embargo, en México es sistemáticamente un mecanismo que les violenta. Este proyecto nace de la conciencia de que los medios de comunicación digitales y audiovisuales representan una herramienta poderosa para la movilización social y el impacto en la opinión pública; ambos, por primera vez en manos ciudadanas. En este sentido consideramos necesario como parte de nuestras estrategias jurídicas para el acompañamiento y defensa legal de mujeres y niñas, reforzar y darle continuidad a nuestras acciones mediáticas y audiovisuales con el objetivo de conseguir mayores y más rápidos resultados para el acceso a la justicia. ¿Qué hemos logrado con las acciones estratégicas de comunicación social que hemos implementado? Hemos generado estrategias de comunicación audiovisual integral y realizamos algunos videos para denunciar públicamente violaciones a los derechos humanos que se cometían en contra de mujeres y niñas; hemos logrado tener impacto nacional e internacional con los casos que acompañamos jurídicamente en dónde la movilización de opinión pública ha servido para incidir en la busqueda de justicia para las víctimas. -Se hizo un acuerdo de colaboración con la plataforma digital Change.org a raíz del impacto de la campaña del año pasado titulada #NoTeCalles para que se diseñara un movimiento digital en donde se aglutinaran las peticiones relacionadas con temas de violencia de género. Actualmente, esta Plataforma #NoTeCalles cuenta con 16 peticiones, 6 victorias y 690,000 personas que han apoyado este tipo de peticiones. -El día 27 de octubre de 2016 monitoreando la sesión del Senado para reformar artículos de la Ley General para Prevenir, Sancionar y Erradicar la Trata de Personas, identificamos a 2 senadores diciendo en tono de “broma” que eran usuarios de trata. Para denunciar eso hicimos un video con sus comentarios y lo divulgamos por las redes sociales, obteniendo más de 15 notas periodísticas que replicaron el video, en nuestras redes tuvimos más de 2,185 reproducciones, pero en Yahoo!-México se obtuvieron 2,872,825 de vistas. -Otro ejemplo, es el caso de Itzel, una niña que actuó #EnDefensaPropia contra su agresor y se le abrió injustamente una carpeta de investigación por homicidio; fue gracias a la movilización pública nacional e internacional que se logró con la campaña que las autoridades cerraran el caso en menos de 24 horas luego de la conferencia de prensa. Ambos videos han recibido más de 16,000, 000 de reproducciones en redes sociales en conjunto con las diversas reediciones que varios medios nacionales e internacionales retomaron para sus notas y programas de TV. Este caso, prácticamente fue publicado en las agendas de la mayor parte de los medios de comunicación nacionales. -Se aumentó exponencialmente la visibilidad de los casos que acompañamos, pues complementando la estrategia de denuncia pública con la de litigio estratégico hemos conseguido importantes logros a favor de la libertad para las mujeres como por ejemplo, #DafneLibreYa, una campaña integral que emprendimos por la libertad de una mujer injustamente sentenciada a 16 años de prisión por tener un parto fortuito en la tienda departamental Liverpool; logramos que su caso fuera revisado por un tribunal colegiado y estamos a la espera de su resolución. ¿Qué vamos a hacer? Realizaremos 3 documentales breves por la justicia y la igualdad de género que convertiremos en mensajes audiovisuales sólidos, argumentados y de alto impacto estratégico en los medios de comunicación nacionales e internacionales que coadyuven en la denuncia y la movilización pública en torno a temas de violencia y falta de acceso a la justicia para mujeres y niñas. Lo anterior como parte de una estrategia mucho más amplia para movilizar la opinión pública en torno al tema y crear las bases de preproducción para el rodaje del primer documental en México que agrupe diversos casos de falta de acceso a la justicia para las mujeres. ¿Cómo puedes ayudarnos y en qué utilizaremos tus donaciones? Necesitamos reunir $8500 dólares para reequipar nuestras oficinas ya que el pasado 18 de noviembre de este año, nuestras oficinas fueron allanadas y todo el equipo de cómputo fue sustraído. Además de recaudar fondos para ayudarnos a reponerle, consideramos prioritario consolidar muestra área de Comunicación Social y realizaremos las siguientes actividades en concreto: 1.-Produciremos 3 campañas que acompañen 3 documentales breves para coadyuvar en casos específicos acceso a la justicia para las mujeres niñas. 2.-Comparemos equipo audiovisual que es necesario para continuar documentado nuestro trabajo (dos micrófonos, una cámara de video básica, un trípode, equipo de computo y un equipo básico de iluminación). 3.-Las filmaciones que realicemos formaran parte de un Documental-Largometraje coproducido con diferentes organizaciones de la sociedad civil acerca del acceso a la justicia para las mujeres en México durante los últimos 10 años y cómo las mujeres ante el panorama adverso que representa su país y el sistema de justicia, logran sobrevivir y convertirse en defensoras de sus derechos y los de otras para con fuerza seguir defendiendo su derecho a una vida libre de violencias. ¿Por qué deberías apoyarnos? Porque necesitamos seguir haciendo nuestro trabajo y luego del allanamiento de pasado 18 de noviembre no contamos con equipo de computo. Las personas que conformamos nuestra organización estamos convencidas de que lograremos nuestros objetivos; somos un colectivo interdisciplinario dedicado a la representación, acompañamiento, defensa jurídica y penal en casos de violaciones a los derechos humanos y de mujeres y niñas y hemos conseguido más de 20 sentencias a favor de los derechos humanos de las mujeres y las niñas, incluidas tres sentencias de la Corte Interamericana de Derechos Humanos entre ellas la primera realizada con perspectiva de género conocida como “Sentencia de Campo Algodonero”. Este aumento de índices de violencia contra las mujeres, ha provocado que las familias de las víctimas busquen el acompañamiento de organizaciones de la sociedad civil, entre ellas, la nuestra. El monto recaudado a través de esta campaña de fondeo permitirá continuar con nuestro trabajo en este sentido para fortalecerle, ampliarle e impulsarle.",,"PRESUPUESTO TOTAL POR RECAUDAR $8500 Dólares Monto Etapa 1: Recuperación de equipo de computo y conformación y consolidación de nuestra área de Comunicación Social para la Justicia $2500 Monto Etapa 2: Equipamiento audiovisual, compra de cámara de video y foto, trípode, dos micrófonos, equipo de computo y tres lámparas básicas de iluminación. $2500 Monto Etapa 3: $4000 Dólares Destino: 1) Producción de 3 documentales y campañas en medios y redes sociales nacionales e internacionales para lograr el acceso a la justicia para las mujeres en México; éstas tendrán resultados claros, medibles comprobables. 2) Preproducción de un Largometraje Documental sobre el Acceso a la Justicia para las Mujeres en México, que presente casos emblemáticos en dónde las mujeres sobrevivientes se han convertido en poderosas defensoras de los derechos humanos propios y de otras mujeres y niñas.",,,ended,,accion_dh,

Help us raise $10,000 by the end of #GivingTuesday! &nbsp; WHY IT MATTERS Each year, hundreds of thousands of women travel to the United States to provide essential caregiving support to families across the country, pick our produce, and even keep U.S. cruise ships afloat. They work seasonally in U.S. factories, on farms, in hotels, and in private homes. These migrant women—who hail from communities across Mexico, and from other locales throughout the Global South—work long months abroad to provide for their families back home. Too often, they confront severe forms of discrimination and human rights violations, which begin in the recruitment process in their home communities and continue in the workplace. Migrant women are often channeled into lower-paying jobs and are cut off from more coveted jobs reserved for men. They are survivors of sexual harassment, pay discrimination, untreated work injuries, and human trafficking. They often work in industries that isolate them from social services and other workers. And although U.S. anti-discrimination, wage, and health and safety laws should protect them, those laws are often not enforced. &nbsp; ABOUT THE PROJECT Through our binational Migrant Women’s Project (Proyecto de Mujeres Migrantes, or ProMuMi), Centro de los Derechos del Migrante, Inc. (CDM) stands with migrant women in demanding equal pay, dignified work, and stronger worker protections. For years, CDM has facilitated workshops with migrant women about their rights in recruitment and employment, cultivated leadership skills, and fostered critical opportunities for migrant women to intervene in policy debates. Migrant women leaders participating in these initiatives have drawn policymakers’ attention to serious flaws in the international labor recruitment process and U.S. guestworker programs. Government agencies and lawmakers have responded, citing CDM and women leaders’ work and vision in implementing important policy reforms.",,,,,ended,,CDMigrante,

Our mission is to ensure that undocumented individuals and families impacted by the fires have the support and resources they need to recover and rebuild their lives in Sonoma County. The UndocuFund will assist with expenses incurred as a direct result of the fires, such as: temporary housing, home repairs, rent, groceries, essential household items, clean-up supplies, medical and dental expenses, tools and equipment required for work, school supplies, repair of essential vehicles, moving and storage expenses, and funeral and burial expenses. The UndocuFund was founded by organizations that many undocumented Sonoma County residents know and trust, and it is supported by a large network of immigrant-serving organizations that have close ties to immigrant communities across Sonoma County. As such, the UndocuFund is more likely to reach undocumented fire victims than any other relief effort. &nbsp; An estimated 38,500 undocumented immigrants live and work in Sonoma County, the area that has been hardest hit by the Northern California fires. It is not yet known how many were displaced from their homes—temporarily or permanently—or how many lost wages or jobs due to the fires. However, undocumented immigrants predominantly work in sectors impacted by the fire, including service, hospitality, child and elder care, day labor, wine, and agriculture. Moreover, unlike other victims, undocumented immigrants do not qualify for assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Even when they are eligible for other disaster relief services, their lack of immigration status, limited English proficiency, and fear of deportation often prevent them from seeking assistance. Their lack of trust in or familiarity with law enforcement, government agencies, and financial institutions presents additional barriers.",,,,,ended,,,

Students have been forced to drop out from high school and join the workforce to help their family cover their mínimum life expenses. This vicious cycle keeps at-risk youth from general education and severely affecting their opportunities to join the labor market. In some cases, the lack of employment opportunities in the area, puts them in a more vulnerable position and thus increases the insecurity of the area. El Salvador records the highest population ever recorded. Over the years, the country has experienced a radical increase in migration, increased family dysfunction, reduced job opportunities and a high staggered poverty rate affecting more than 40% of the population. And to further complicate the situation, 7 out of 10 students do not exceed an education level beyond the ninth grade. That is why FUCAES, El Salvador Training Center Foundation, provides with vocational training, to young people in the ages of 15 to 30 years old, to develop and meet specific skills required by the labor market. Why is it important? As the skills and training of young people in the area are improved, San Miguel Tepezontes will be able to offer better opportunities to the community. A safer, more stable and entrepreneurial population will encourage economic productivity thus increasing household income of the young people trained and transforming the lives of their families.

They also get their alimentation from the food waste that arrives to the landfill. 70% of them are restrained from education due to their need to help their families at waste picking. It is not fair, children should be at school. The civil association Solidary Entrepreneurs Juvenile Mixed Cooperative (CMJ) collaborates hand in hand with Sulambiente, Operación Bendición., Thread International and some volunteers for their job security, mainly for them to study in 2018. We invite you to be a part of this loable labor. It only takes to take a look on their faces, their humble clothing, their smiles full of hope when they talk about what they want to become when they grow up for your heart to beat or even shed a tear. But that’s not enough, help doesn’t come from those who can but by those who want. Operación Bendición is giving away scholarships, but we need health supplements, education materials and the services from a psychologist to the children but mainly their parents, because they force them to work, which impedes Genesis from becoming a doctor, her brother José to become an engineer and David to become a doctor. David is 12 years old and started working since he was just 4 at the landfill. Psychological evaluations have been given to 150 children thanks to volunteering psychologists. David, Genesis and José’s mother and grandmother are single mothers which shows how irresponsible parenthood and violation of women’s rights are the main cause of these problems. This cycle repeats itself in the life of several teenage females that scavenge at the landfill due to their early pregnancies, situation that’s being handled and prevented by CMJ with the help of Global Fund the Children (GFC). Education is the key to prevent child labor, teenage pregnancy, and the violation of women’s rights. It may seem like the dream of becoming an engineer sound like just a dream but you and I can make it become a reality.

This initiative was announced in 2012 because they are not taken into account in decision making and with little access to media. In 2013 they met María coj Sohom, she got married at a young age because of the lack of information, and one of the consequences is rejected and violated of her rights by her husband, is one of the examples; When evaluating our context, it was detected that many women suffer from intrafamilial violence in their homes, do not have a learning space and are not taken into account in public office just for the simple fact of being women. It really is a very difficult situation because they are not enjoying their freedom of expression, they do not have the same opportunities, that is why ASOMUJERDI described the need that if it is important to be heard the voices of women with their own media, and decided to work with the right to communication that is one of the fundamental pillars to democratize the word of Mayan women in Guatemala. This 2017, One of the ventures is creativity in the operation of a community radio &#8221; The Voice of Racantacaj&#8221;, it is amazing the creativity of young women where they raised an antenna with 3 sticks and a transmitter spell of just 5 watts that is currently working for the community of Racantacaj, they have created the movement of communicators for the Mayan K&#8217;iche &#8216;people and which is now led by 160 girls, adolescents and women from 7 years old and upwards with the support of the community. HOW WE WILL PUT YOUR DONATIONS IN ACTION: Your donation will contribute to the purchase of devices that will expand the coverage of our community radio &#8220;The Voice of Racantacaj&#8221;. Our goal is to raise US $ 5000 (five thousand dollars) distributed as follows: 1.) $ 4557.14 to buy a transmitter brand RVR Model TEX-300 LCD / 300 Watts / Stereo / Digital Display Italian Manufacturing. 2.) $ 442.86 to buy a ring type antenna, circular polarization, stainless steel, solid / supports 800 Watts maximum. BECAUSE IT IS IMPORTANT: Radio &#8220;The Voice of Racantacaj&#8221; contributes in the social struggles of our peoples, it is more than a traditional means of communication; a tool of empowerment and resistance that strengthens our Mayan culture, sensitizes, educates and sensitizes communities about our rights through their programming in our own K&#8217;iche &#8216;language. It is also the only means of communication led by girls, adolescents and women, which will allow their voices to reach other areas of Nahualá. Our dream is to reach many women with the radio and help them transform their lives. However, the radio is very small and with a transmitter spell, sometimes it moves in its frequency, but that does not stop us. We believe that with the purchase of a transmitter of 300 Watts, we will be able to project our voices and thus reach the more than 95 thousand inhabitants of the municipality of Nahualá in the Department of Sololá, Guatemala. Despite the current low coverage of our radio, it has played a fundamental role in the defense of our rights. We are the only radio that has content about human rights in its programs and the most listened throughout the territory of the Racantacaj community. POTENTIAL CHALLENGES: With your support, our dreams become a reality, by meeting our goal of raising the amount of US $ 5000 (five thousand dollars). If we do not reach the goal, your support will continue to be significant, since it can contribute to cover other radio needs such as the purchase of a Stereo Voice processor, cables, microphones and a digital recorder for interviews. We already want to thank you for your donation and for helping us spread our campaign. ABOUT OUR ORGANIZATION: Agrupación Asomujerdi, is a community-based, secular, non-partisan and non-profit organization, works with young women and indigenous girls defending their human rights and community journalists with the right to communication in Sololá.

Driven by curiosity, we have worked to bridge the worlds of traditional wisdom and urban modernity in as many creative ways as possible, taking risks nobody has taken before for indigenous pottery. What began as a personal investigation quickly connected to much wider concerns about who we are, at we want to become, and where we are headed as a civilization. WHY IT MATTERS: For us, it’s more important than ever to consider the wisdom of traditional cultures to move forward as a civilization. We believe some of the most pressing problems of today&#8217;s world can be well informed by traditional cultures to find unique solutions inspire by their knowledge. Potters can show us the way forward with the wisdom they hold in their hands. Every day the potters of Oaxaca transform the world with their hands, and every day we have made a commitment to be bold in opening up more paths for pottery to survive for many more centuries. The questions that have guided us during this time have become richer, deeper and more complex. We hope you will see our invitation for you to join the Four Movements as an opportunity for you to deepen your connection o the wisdom of their craft, their close connection to the earth, and their community. &nbsp; We invite you to invest today in our Four Movements to ensure Oaxacan artisans can thrive! THE KNOWLEDGE COMMUNITY BUILDING knowledge community for artisan empowerment. How can we support the 70 indigenous villages of Oaxaca help each other through the creation of a Knowledge Community? We are creating an artisan to artisan model of training and growth built by and with the artisans themselves, as a space to share challenges and strengthen their knowledge, make it visible to the world and encourage new generations to continue this craft. Help us take the next step with them with a pioneering program of artisan-to-artisan training. This initiative will make it possible for us to document and preserve traditional techniques, to expand their skills to other areas so that they become powerful leaders in their communities to preserve and transmit their vision and the profound cultural knowledge they hold. &nbsp; HOUSE OF CLAY INITIATIVE ESTABLISHING a home in Oaxaca for living traditions. How can we help make their wisdom more accessible to the world and project it to places never before imagined? &nbsp; Help us build a special, world- renowned center in Oaxaca, a space for designers, researchers, educators and friends of our international community to meet, explore and collaborate. A workshop, gallery and museum space for traditional knowledge. This center will provide a space for collaboration for all of the artisans, potters and others, from all over Oaxaca. &nbsp; THE HANDMADE INITIATIVE DESIGNING a groundbreaking approach for artisans. How can we crystallize our experience and the knowledge of artisans to create a more balanced world? In a world that has based its growth on unrestrained exploitation, you can help us codify, advance and share with the world our principles, philosophy and methodologies, developed from a decade of work with artisans who embody an alternative way to live in balance. After 12 years of experimenting carefully and with precision, with our methods and tools. It is time to share them with the world as a strategy to promote parallel growth, chaniges in the design field and in Mexican public policy towards artisans. &nbsp; COLECTIVO 1050• WE TRANSFORM MUD INTO BEAUTY to open new markets around the world How can we place a pot in all the tables of the world and in doing so create a lifeline to the 70 pottery villages? COLECTIVO 1050• creates commercial and cultural bridges between traditional and modern world by creating the conditions to open more markets, for more potters from more villages. In this way, new paths will be continously discovered to place pottery where it has never been before. The iincome to pottery families within Colectivo 1050• will continue to increase as it has happened since 2008 when we started saling the results of the training provided by Innovando la Tradicion AC.

We believe people should have the right to make reproductive health care decisions in accordance with their faith, family and health care provider.

The program is open to youth who identify at Latinas 16-21 years old in the Denver metro area. We engage participants in a vibrant community of activists. LIPS mentors the next generation of Latina leaders to promote the advancement of the Latinx community and advocate for reproductive justice issues. Our programs serve as entry points for young Latinas to become engaged with organizing and advocacy. “LIPS gave me a foundation of knowledge and introduced me to key people that shared opportunities [with] me, which allowed me to navigate the Denver political field and become more involved in activities that interested me.” &#8212; LIPS alumna The LIPS program offers educational and developmental tools that are culturally-relevant, community-centered, and necessary for true community empowerment.

LIPS participants learn about reproductive justice, intersectional feminism, the role of governments &amp; politicians, campaign building, lobbying, fundraising, communications, public speaking, and networking. Classes are a mix of highly interactive lessons, hands-on workshops, and project-based learning assignments. Participation in COLOR events and volunteering provides opportunities for “learning by doing,” and the mentorship program provides a venue for learning vicariously. At COLOR, we think of mentorship as a key way to build a thriving leadership pipeline and believe that mentorship serves both individuals by providing new opportunities for personal development. Participants are linked with a mentor who assists in guiding their development and involvement in the community. Mentors attend events, share their experiences, assist with the participant&#8217;s projects, and provide support in any way possible for the LIPS participant to be successful.",,,,,ended,,,

Anti-immigrant rhetoric and sentiment around the globe creates an antagonistic environment in which it becomes difficult to promote healthy, just migration and dignified opportunities for all. Now, more than ever,&nbsp;we need to tell the true stories about what is driving migration and the many positive contributions that migrants make to the United States and to their countries of origin. Alianza Americas&#8217; goal is to ensure that migrant communities are treated in a just and equitable manner reflecting the thousands of ways they contribute to economic prosperity and to the rich cultural fabric of both their countries of origin and those to which they migrate. SOMOS/WE ARE is a collaborative initiative developed by Alianza Americas&nbsp;and its members and allies that &nbsp;focuses on story-telling as a way to share&nbsp;individual stories while bringing to light the positive contributions of the immigrant community. The SOMOS/WE ARE initiative works with children, youth and adults to promote healthy identities in Latin American youth and combat xenophobia using discussion, art, music, video, and other cultural expressions to tell the true stories of immigrants, their children, and our communities 2017 SOMOS/WE ARE Programming includes: Speaking tours that bring the realities of Central American women and children to audiences across the US Art programs for youth that allow them to fight back against racism and xenophobia through their own creativity.

With your support, Maya, along with Neesa Medina, a Honduran Women&#8217;s rights activist, will return to the US for another round of visits to the Midwest and wherever we have the most demand in October. Send a kid to Art Camp: Last year, we were able to support two art camps in New Jersey and Florida, and a youth art workshop in the Bronx. Other communities hosted art competitions and discussion circles. A few youth participants were selected to attend the Alianza Americas national Assembly in Washington, in November where they spoke about the power of their experience.

Natural disasters have become increasingly stronger and more frequent ultimately caused by the negative effects of climate change and they do not discriminate. In some cases the blow is short lived and manageable but in others it can take months to gain back the essential resources most of us have grown dependent on. &nbsp; Power, Communications and Refrigeration are three elements engrained in our lives. Our “Solar Powered Survival Kit” covers all 3 of these needs by offering solar power and back up battery storage to power cell phones, laptops, fans and power tools, a Wi-Fi router that connects to Wi-Fi even when all signals are non existent and a refrigerator chest that offers ample refrigeration for any medical needs, baby’s milk or other temp sensitive critical items. &nbsp; Why us? Our team has experienced first hand the ravishing effects of hurricanes in varying degrees. Our founder was displaced from her home in a suburb in New York for over 4 months during Superstorm Sandy. At the time she and her husband were executives for one of the largest construction firms in the world but even with so many resources at their fingertips nothing could hold back the ocean from entering their home, destroying their vehicles and ultimately leaving them helpless for days with no means to communicate or get help. This was an aha moment for the experienced solar expert, civil engineer and Climate Reality leader but it took a number more years to come up with the ultimate solar survival solution. The team has a combined three decades of experience working both with solar and telecommunications technology and have expertise in operations management, corporate strategy development and community building. After hurricane Irma struck and hit home quite literally the team formed, pooled their knowledge and resources and in a very organic process built out the solar survival solution. With a proven solution that is both affordable and easy to implement the team felt compelled to act. Immediately going in to production mode and sending the first kits to Puerto Rico. “This is our calling and we are responding!” &nbsp; Yes – we have a goal and a feasible plan to execute on! We have pin pointed a series of communal shared centers across Puerto Rico with a focus on the areas hit hardest by hurricane Maria. We have targeted a series of facilities ranging from shelters, community centers, schools, soup kitchens, medical facilities, orphanages and places of worship to bring our solar relief. While it is quite unimaginable, these towns and city’s are still without power and reliable communication. Our solar survival kits are pre-wired and easy to install and within hours can provide relief both as a stop gap or a long-term solution. As long as the sun rises everyday our kits will be useful and dependable. Even when the power is restored it has become increasingly obvious that back up measures must be in place so no one suffers unnecessarily when the next disaster strikes. &nbsp; So why does it matter? Each center we light up will bring immediate relief to the people it touches. We can count the number of lives we impact quite literally. This isn’t an abstract form of giving. Your donations will go directly toward solar survival kits. But there is more… This project has an everlasting giving effect! In addition to providing direct relief we will essentially be demonstrating on a real-life stage how solar is the appropriate solution that will fix immediate problems while solving the overarching larger scale problem and ultimate cause of the powerful hurricane to begin with – climate change. &nbsp; Why should you trust us? With a track record of advocacy, education and team building in the solar industry for a dozen years and an additional two dozen in telecommunications, ground logistics and project management we have what it takes to get this job done. All funds will go directly to purchasing the equipment components needed to assemble the kits, crating, shipping, and distribution with minimal labor for installation and overhead. The funds will always go toward the kits. If we don’t meet our goal we will light up less centers but all the money will be spent toward providing power back to the people.

The community has no access to drinking water and in most cases, to electricity. The impoverished conditions suffered by the residents has negatively affected the health and malnutrition of the of community, specifically in the children. The lack of drinking water obliges them to obtain rainwater or contaminated water from the river, causing diseases of parasitism, gastroenteritis, multiple infections and bacteria. The children are at high risk of suffering from diseases that will affect their development in the long run – becoming a leading contributor to altered behavior outcome and school performance. Such precarious condition will affects their integral development and chances of succeding later in life. The Project “Pasitos de Amor” consists on providing a routine medical check-up including: lab examinations, nutritional programs, psychological therapies, dental hygiene, vitamins and medicines. And, as a preventive action, a homemade water purifying filter will be delivered free of charge to every household in the community. During the delivery process, proper training of usage and benefits will be provided to the families. Why is it important? Receiving adequate nutrition, food hygiene, and medical care at an early age provide multiple benefits in the child&#8217;s physical development aside from improves his or her cognitive skills in the future. How will the funds be used? We need to raise $ 5,096 to benefit a total of 96 children (between 3 and 16 years of age) with medical days and 1 filter of water will be given to 80 different homes.

This historic storm has underscored the urgent need—and created new opportunities—to rethink education in Puerto Rico. Now, more than ever, students need to be empowered to become problem solvers and play an active role in Puerto Rico’s recovery. To achieve this,&nbsp;Ciencia Puerto Rico (CienciaPR) is launching a pilot project to bring together scientists, educators, and students to facilitate that they co-create of science lessons that encourage creativity, resilience, entrepreneurship, and the development of problem-solving skills.&nbsp;The initial set of science lessons focuses on renewable energy, environmental sustainability, clean and potable water, and terrestrial ecosystems—topics that are not only relevant immediately after Hurricane Maria, but for a stronger and more resilient Puerto Rico in the long-term. The lessons, developed in partnership with&nbsp;Echar Pa’lante, a multi-sector coalition in Puerto Rico that promotes education and innovation, can be followed and applied in schools, as well as at home, in community centers, and in after-school programs, allowing students displaced and affected by the hurricane to continue learning. They incorporate project-based learning and community service to teach students how science is relevant to their lives and culture, and how it could help them solve problems faced by their communities. Your donation will help us meet our goals of: identifying and training 50 educators in Puerto Rico on how to use and implement the lesson plans by March 2018; purchasing and delivering low-cost research and educational materials, including the paper-based microscope&nbsp;Foldscope, to up 2,500 Puerto Rican students by March 2018; and disseminating the results of students&#8217; projects so that they can inform their communities and help us impact thousands of people in Puerto Rico. This pilot project will kick off the implementation of our new strategic direction of&nbsp;transforming science education in Puerto Rico by bringing discovery, experimentation and problem-solving into classrooms in a way that is relevant to the culture and reality of Puerto Rican students.&nbsp;For the past year-and-a-half CienciaPR has been hard at work on a bold 10-year plan to do this. Hurricane Maria made our new goals even more urgent. Moreover, what we learn from this project can benefit students around the world who are affected and/or displaced by natural disasters. You can read more about CienciaPR’s new 10-year strategic plan HERE. BUILDING UPON CIENCIAPR’S SUCCESS&nbsp; This project and our new strategic direction build upon CienciaPR’s decade-long success harnessing the power of its vast scientific community to create social impact in Puerto Rico by improving scientific literacy, increasing access to role models, and creating culturally relevant science education resources. Through projects like&nbsp;Semillas de Triunfo,&nbsp;Ciencia Boricua, and&nbsp;others, we have involved more than 270 scientists in education and outreach, trained over 390 teachers to make science education more relevant to their students’ lives, and engaged more than 100 middle school students in service-based science outreach projects that impacted over 10,500 people.

The themes of the program are peaceful conflict resolution, democracy and human rights, gender equity, environmental sustainability, and intercultural understanding. The main objective of the project is to train a new generation of leaders by promoting self-reflection, encouraging short and long-term thinking, empowering dreams and ambitions for the future, strengthening the relationships of the school and home, the development of social networks and the ability to build them. There are more than 800 children who have participated in this project since it began in 2010. We work 10 workshops (approximately 3 months) with groups of 12-16 participants (ideally), if possible with an equitable distribution of girls and boys. The intention is that each group should be a mix of students from different family backgrounds and academic achievement levels. Each workshop is attended by 1-2 facilitators. &nbsp; How will we use the funds?&nbsp; With the funds raised we can benefit a total of 64 children from 4 different schools in the area of Chiltiupán, La Libertad. The funds will be distributed to the mobilization to the schools, to the search and purchase of didactic materials, including books according to the topics that we will develop and the purchase of refreshments for each session.",,Presupuesto &#8211; Leyendo para el futuro Descripción Costo Servicios profesionales 1000 Oficina 1000 Libros y Materiales 1200 Transporte y Movilización 600 Refrigerios para talleres 600 Eventos 300 Otros 300 Costo total 5000 Reading for the future &#8211; Budget Description Cost Professional Services 1000 Office 1000 Books and materials 1200 Transport and movilization 600 Workshop refreshments 600 Events 300 Others 300 Total cost 5000,,,ended,,,

Due to the devastating effects of Hurricane María in Puerto Rico, and the extremely slow response of local and federal government agencies, we have established an emergency fund to provide basic supplies and food for our participants and devastated communities throughout the island. Some of our participants suffered partial or complete loss of their homes, so any help they can receive is critical. The extreme devastation that Hurricane María caused in rural, low income communities was in large part due to the precarious conditions that existed before natural disaster struck. Given the urgent need to rebuild these communities in a solidary, resilient, self-sustaining way &#8211; and to prevent the recurrence of a similar tragedy- we are developing and proposing a community center model to give the residents the tools to initiate a sustainable and participative recovery process that will address poverty issues as well as the potential struck of another hurricane in a geographical area that has always been susceptible to tropical storms and hurricanes. We are working to supply the following services: Community Kitchen: will provide hot meals and food to families that are in need- Solidary School: serve as a classroom for children whose local public schools remain closed after the disaster. Also providing an alphabetization program for illiterate adults in the community. Business Incubator: using Matria&#8217;s existing incubation model, and it could also include startup funding for the small businesses to start operating (this is subject to fund availability). It would also coordinate technical training so participants can develop the entrepreneurial skills required for the businesses. Psycho-social services, along with prevention and intervention in situations of intrafamily violence. Evaluation of damaged home structures to coordinate their reconstruction. We are also trying to coordinate medical services so they can be integrated into the model &nbsp; Please help us get our beautiful island and its people back on its feet. No amount is too small to help, and we would also appreciate if you shared this fundraiser with your social media contacts.

Help us make our students dreams of college success a reality &#8211; Si Se Puede!,"Our Mission Project Stepping Stone of Indiana was launched in 2003. Our one-week college prep summer program (in June) helps Latino high school sophomores and juniors prepare for college and beyond. Selected students will be introduced to potential careers and includes visits to several of Indiana’s leading college campuses and businesses. Admission to the program is selective and is merit based. As educators, business leaders, and influencers who touch the lives of many students, we are challenged daily by the obstacles that keep low-and moderate-income students from moving on to higher education. For most of our students, the dream of going to college seems out of reach. PSS provides the opportunity for students to see the value of education beyond high school and we help underscore how critical a college degree can become to realizing their dream for themselves and their families. At PSS, we turn dreams into reality. Our Goal Our goal is to improve post-secondary enrollment among Indiana&#8217;s Latino high school students. Project Stepping Stone of Indiana has a 13-year track record of success in preparing the state’s Latino high schools students for college and career success. Since its inception, PSS has witnessed a positive success rate in getting our graduates into college. In fact, over 80% of the seniors who attended Project Stepping Stone go on to pursue a post secondary degree. In turn, many of these students inspire and encourage other students in their communities. The funding requested will be used to support operations of the program and ongoing student support (transportation of students, meals, housing, etc.). This program is offered at no cost to students and is carried out by a 100% volunteer crew and funded by the generosity of individuals and corporate partners. It is a 501(c)3 program under the Indiana Latino Institute (EIN: 26-0036285). Why It Matters A significant number of PSS student participants come from low-income families and communities. Over 85% also identify as the first in their family to attend college. We believe education is the key to breaking the cycle of poverty in our community. The gap in levels of educational attainment among Latino adults age 25 and older also remains a challenge. 40.4% of US born Latinos in the state and 53.1% of Latin American born adults fail to graduate from high school versus 14.7% for all adults. Even more critical, only 11.3% of US born Latinos in the state and 8.4% of Latin American born adults attain a bachelor’s degree versus 21.2% for all Hoosiers. According to U.S Census Bureau data, there remains a significant discrepancy in income and poverty levels between Indiana’s Latino and non-Latino populations (19.3% of US born Latinos in the state and 23.8% of Latin American born families live in poverty versus 9.0% of families for the overall state population). We are here to change these stats – one student at a time! Call To Action We welcome you to join our cause by donating to our campaign. Any amount goes a long way to helping us impact the lives of our students. Help us spread the word about our crowdfunding campaign by sharing the link on your social media networks (Facebook, LinkedIN, etc.) and with your family and friends.

The campaign seeks to support the community with the donation of sports equipment to keep transforming the lives of teens at-risk.","History Soyapango is the most populous city in the state of San Salvador (Est. 2014: 276K) and the third most violent in the country. The chronic violence that the youth of Soyapango have been exposed to has impacted their emotional, academic, and behavior. As many of the youth residing in Soyapango have witnessed community violence, its residents live with a never-ending feeling of fear. The gangs control the entire territory and the indirect victims are far more numerous. Residents are afraid as their reign of violence is merciless and severe. The leaders of the communities understand that culture plays a key role in violence, and they try to prevent the situation from worsening. Cesar Carrión, who works for the City´s Town Hall in the department of Trash Collection, founded in 2010 the Soccer Academy “Villa Kiwanis” with the sole objective of rescuing the youth that live directly exposed to violence. The school holds classes on Wednesday and Thursday afternoon. Why is it important? César is a man with limited resources and lacks the support of any organization. However, Cesar has used his own resources to keep the academy running. Together with the community, Cesar has been able to purchase soccer equipment for training. After 7 years of hard work and sacrifice, Cesar has witnessed the positive influence sports activities has on the physical, psychological and social development of children. The community has successfully kept these children away from joining the gangs. Cesar works overtime to cover the operating costs of the Soccer Academy. His noble and sacrificed work has transformed the lives of many young people, where today apart from practicing a sport, they have understood the benefits of living a life with values and principles far from bad habits and behaviors. How will the funds be used? This project seeks to support the community with the donation of sports equipment. The children play barefoot and used inappropriate clothing.

Every year millions of people become victims of human trafficking, and while human trafficking can take on many forms and target diverse types of victims, sex trafficking predominantly affects women and girls. In San Diego, sex trafficking is an $810 million industry, with an estimated 3,000-8,000 victims every year. The other side of the U.S.-Mexico border is similarly experiencing a high rate of human trafficking. Hispanics in Philanthropy&#8217;s recent human trafficking report found that Tijuana is one of Mexico&#8217;s hot spots for sex trafficking. Yet, PCI&#8217;s analysis of the sex trafficking response in both cities identified a gap in prevention efforts. In San Diego, we have responded with programs to reduce the vulnerability of women and girls to sex trafficking, campaigns to educate the public, and partnerships to reduce demand, and we are aiming to expand those efforts to Tijuana with your helep. PCI&#8217;s mission of empowering some of the world&#8217;s most vulnerable people to enhance their health, end hunger, and overcome hardship has its roots in the San Diego-Tijuana border region where we have worked for over 50 years. This is our home, and we know it well&#8211;allowing us to effectively work with our partners and our communities to design programs that not only have meaningful impact on people&#8217;s lives, but also achieve the maximum impact possible with the funds we receive (89% of all cash donations directly support our programs) and are sustainable once project funding comes to an end. Our work in both cities has brought PCI face-to-face with how sex trafficking is destroying lives, and has prompted us to ask ourselves how we can prevent this from happening in the first place. PCI&#8217;s response to human trafficking in San Diego has included the successful implementation of two empowerment programs in the city&#8217;s immigrant and refugee neighborhoods&#8211;one focusing on girls and the other on women. When vulnerable women and girls are provided with appropriate education, emotional support and life skills, their awareness and resiliency in risky environments are increased, making them less likely to become victims of sex trafficking. Girls Only!, is an after-school program that empowers girls through the promotion of positive self-esteem, education on the dangers of trafficking, and life skills development. Girls Only! builds resiliency in girls by providing them with inspiring mentors and collaborative peer guidance, interactive lesson plans, and a place to be listened to and feel safe. This unique program gives young girls the resources to find alternatives to the kinds of abusive relationships that often lead to involvement with trafficking, substance abuse, sexual assault, and eventually the criminal justice system. Women Empowered (WE) serves migrants in San Diego&#8217;s migrant-heavy neighborhoods and in over a dozen countries. WE is a savings-led microfinance program that strengthens the life skills and financial knowledge of participants. The goal of WE is to empower women to become agents of change by equipping them with the income, tools, abilities, and confidence to transform their lives and those of their families and communities. These efforts lead to increased income-generating opportunities and connect under-served communities to social support systems. Factors such as low levels of education and self-esteem, poverty, and domestic abuse increase the vulnerability of women and girls to sex trafficking. With your help, PCI can bring our prevention programs to Tijuana, Mexico. Why it Matters: Improving resiliency on our side of the border will positively affect the other and vice versa&#8211;given how interconnected both cities are. Implementing a trafficking prevention program in Tijuana will allow PCI to raise awareness and bring other key players to the table. This prevention program will serve as a platform for collaboration and coordination, providing a synergy that is very much needed given the scarcity of resources to address this issue in a comprehensive manner. Expanding this work in Tijuana will complement other efforts in the community to address key factors that are contributing to trafficking vulnerabilities faced by young women and girls. By combining life skills with confidence-building and community strengthening activities, these programs enable girls and women to be the authors of their own destinies, like Jasneek and Maria. Jasneek, an 11-year old Girls Only! participant began participating in the program when she was nine and is now involved as an older student helper. Recently, she wont the Student-of-the-Year award at her school and continues to thrive as a strong young women. Jasneek&#8217;s story is documented in the virtual reality film below, demonstrating the importance PCI&#8217;s programming has on her life and her community. Maria, a WE member in the highlands of Huehuetenango, Guatemala, was concerned about the fate of children from her community that were being sent to the United States with traffickers promising parents that their children would be safely delivered to relatives. As more information came to light that these promises weren&#8217;t always kept, and that the fate of these children may have actually been a nightmare of the worst kind, she and other members of her Women Empowered group brought the issue up at a WE meeting. They ultimately decided to prevent trafficking by educating their community about the dangers of human trafficking and how to avoid being lured into sending children with traffickers, as well as avoid falling victim to it as an adult. As a result, the number of children in the community sent to the U.S. dropped. Success of both projects is carefully measured through multi-dimensional, innovate monitoring and evaluation tools that look at participant&#8217;s increased resiliency and self-esteem, as well as increased knowledge and other factors. For more information on how PCI measures the impact of its programs, check out our annual report. PCI has over five decades of experience and demonstrated impact in integrated and community-driven programming. We currently have 65 active projects with significant focus on: community mobilization and resilience; local capacity strengthening; women&#8217;s empowerment and gender-sensitivity; and, youth leadership. Worldwide, we are increasingly recognized for our forward-thinking leadership, particularly in the areas of innovation and sustainable impact. Our organizational commitments to equity, non-discrimination, inclusion, the empowerment of women and girls, the engagement of men in areas where they typically don&#8217;t participate such as maternal and child health and nutrition, and joint household decision-making are guided by the theme of &#8220;nothing for us without us&#8221;, reflecting our sensitivity to the need to truly engage people, including the most marginalized, not only as recipients of program services and products, but as actively engaged partners in program design and implementation. How we&#8217;ll put your donations to work: Eighty-nine cents of every dollar donated to PCI goes to programs. These campaign funds would be no different. The full $50,000 will enable us to plan and launch these female empowerment pilots in Tijuana. If the full amount is not received, PCI will allocate the funds to the creation of WE groups and Girls Only! programming targeting Hispanic populations in San Diego in the following amounts: Enroll one woman in a WE savings group $250 A goal of this size can enroll one woman in PCI&#8217;s 18-month Women Empowered program. Women learn financial literacy and gain social support from other women in their group; providing endless opportunities for all. Support a WE savings group $1,000 Women are stronger when they stand together. A fundraising goal of this size can support a savings group. Groups can support each member when they need it the most, and they work together to make positive changes in their communities. Fight trafficking and violence $10,000 A fundraising goal of this size can expand after-school programs to build the resiliency and self-esteem of young girls to inspire, motivate, and empower youth against the dangers of trafficking and violence. Other ways people can help: While funds are essential, you can make a strong contribution to the efforts just by sharing this campaign with your friends, famliy, and office. Peer-to-peer fundraising is very effective, and we&#8217;d be grateful for your support as a campaign ambassador. Below is some language you can use to share this cause through social media: The fight to end sex trafficking begins with prevention. Join me and PCI in our efforts to expand successful female empowerment programming from San Diego to Tijuana, and together we can prevent more victims of human trafficking.&nbsp; We also invite you to follow our social media and blog which continuously highlight the impact of our work and continued needs and opportunities.",,,,,ended,,PCIGlobal,

However, the promotion of civic and social conscience allows for young Venezuelans, as well as the overall Venezuelan community, to benefit from the innovative brainstorming that happens during the two days of discussion. Uniting the diaspora of young Venezuelans under the common goal of educating themselves so that they may become informed citizens, allows us to channel these thoughts as a community and become a more mature society with the tools necessary for change. How Plan Pais Helps Plan País is a two-day conference that aims at connecting young Venezuelans to the current situation in the country, providing an educational experience where participants can learn about the country’s most pressing issues, and also creating a network of young Venezuelans abroad who can collaborate in a number of projects. Previous conferences have been held in distinguished universities like Yale University, Georgetown, MIT, Columbia, the University of Texas at Austin, University of Florida, The George Washington University, and Boston University. The 2019 Plan Pais Conference will be held in March 2019 at the University of South Florida in Tampa. The event is an impartial platform for young Venezuelans to discuss and create a vision for what they want the present and the future of Venezuela to look like. Renowned experts guide students in a variety of fields such as human rights, economics, education, infrastructure, oil &amp; gas, health, education, communications, and others.

The HEM is a palliative care service that provides patients and their families’ with a comprehensive and integrated care that helps them face with dignity and quality of life the most critical moments of pediatric cancer. We seek to alleviate the child&#8217;s pain and other symptoms that accompany the illness, providing emotional support for the whole family. The care provided to the child mitigates the suffering at critical moments of the illness, receiving specialized medical support, pain relief, and attention to other discomforts such as nausea and breathing difficulties. The HEM provides health care services, palliative care, shelter and food, psychological, spiritual and grief support; as well as funeral services for families with a low-income. The attention is tailored to each child&#8217;s needs. Helping the child&#8217;s family to cope with the situation, sharing together precious moments, creating new memories for the future and supporting each other in a family environment filled with love, peace and tranquility, as if it were a second home. How we&#8217;ll put your donations to work: Oxygen is critical during palliative care in the HEM, and is an indispensable tool to provide adequate medical care and quality of life for children. With this campaign we seek to ensure the provision of oxygen for terminal children with cancer for the next seven (7) months. The cost of oxygen for the children we serve in the hospice amounts to USD $1,260 per month. And we attend approximately twenty-four children per month. In the past two years, HEM has treated more than two hundred eighteen children, and we hope to continue caring for more children who need palliative care. This means that we need to increase our oxygen supplies in the short and medium term. · With a $50, $100 or more donation, you can help mitigate the anxiety of a child, which occurs when they have trouble breathing. · With $120 you can support the cost of a day’s-bed, which includes all the integrated care services of the HEM: medical care, medicines, shelter and food for the child and parents, and patient support services. Why it matters: The HEM welcomes each family to reassess family life, and together with their child dissipate the hopelessness and despair they are feeling, in order to maximize the precious moments being shared. Every child that arrives at the HEM has lived an intense fight against cancer with his/her parents. It is at this time, when the child needs all the attention and love from his/hers parents and relatives; and feel the comfort and accompaniment to mitigate the fears. Other ways you can help: Help us share our project among your contacts or invite a friend of yours to donate. If you live in Guatemala you can come and visit our project, you can call, write and/or make an appointment to see for yourself the work AYUVI is doing to help our cancer children. Call us at Ph.

We are working towards this mission through projects aimed at increasing civic engagement in the immigrant community, providing direct services that are flexible and responsive to the tumultuous political climate, and building the next generation of social justice legal professionals&#8211;especially by addressing barriers to the legal profession facing immigrants and people of color. &nbsp; Our justice system should not pick and choose who it serves based on how much money they have or where they were born.

El índice de machismo ejercidos por algunos hombres, cada día es mayor, desde el año 2012 hasta 2017 se han registrado 351 femicidios y sigue en aumento. Esta es la expresión más grave del machismo, por lo que las demás expresiones como la violencia sexual, el acoso callejero, violencia patrimonial y económica, psicológica, física, emocional&#8230; contra las mujeres son constantes y alarmantes. Como mujeres jóvenes organizadas, estamos haciendo incidencia promoviendo el fútbol femenino libre de violencia, en los espacios públicos y privados, impulsando cursos de autodefensa feminista y sensibilizando en las diferentes comunidades y municipios a través de campañas contra los abusos sexuales. Con tu aporte, será posible llevar a cabo torneos de fútbol, charlas y talleres sobre la prevencion de la violencia, intercambios de futbol entre jovenas de las comunidades como parte de la campaña del 25 de noviembre, el día contra violencia machista, para así poder pronunciarnos y protestar, reivindicando nuestros derechos. También, destinaremos el dinero en la realización de diferentes talleres que permiten la autonomía, empoderamiento y fortalecimiento de las mujeres jóvenes, como talleres de autodefensa feminista, talleres de autocuidado&#8230; Además, permitirá el desarrollo y seguimiento de la campaña contra abusos sexuales, la cual es muy importante, ya que nos permite llegar a las diferentes comunidades, brindando herramientas y recursos a las jóvenes para protegerse y poder trasmitir estos conocimientos a otras jóvenes, creando así redes de apoyo y confianza entre ellas. En el movimiento de jóvenes Lidia Espinoza, hemos logrado muchos de los objetivos propuestos, apropiándonos de campos de fútbol, reivindicándolos como espacios para mujeres, enfrentándonos a situaciones de discriminación, acoso verbal, psicológico, etc. Pero finalmente, obteniendo el respeto y reconocimiento de las comunidades y varones en el campo de fútbol. Después de ejecutar varios talleres sobre relaciones entre mujeres, los resultados fueron muy satisfactorios, ya que muchas de las chavalas participantes lograron llevar a la práctica las herramientas adquiridas en el taller, pudiendo negociar con sus familias y haciéndoles reflexionar sobre la división de tareas del hogar entre hombres y mujeres, proporcionándoles así más tiempo libre para sí mismas. Hasta ahora, todos los procesos que se han llevado a cabo a través de la organización han tenido buenos resultados. Las chavalas han logrado ser más autónomas, a cuidar y a defender su propio cuerpo y sus derechos, a tener metas claras, a identificar el machismo en las diferentes situaciones, a defenderse, a saber decir que NO, etc. Posibilitando paulatinamente, una vida más igualitaria.

In-person accompaniment is a program for school strengthening addressed to teachers that promotes the integration of technology in teaching &#8211; learning processes through the integration of a professional with a pedagogical profile in the school community. The component of accompaniment of the presence begins at the beginning of the school year with a professional in pedagogy who will presently provide advisory to the teachers. Companions assess the digital and technological skills of the teachers to ensure that all have the necessary basic knowledge.

Recent studies have showed that Latina women in California earn only 43 cents to the dollar of while non-hispanic man. In 2016, white families had a median net worth of $171,000, compared with $20,700 for Latino households. In Watsonville, 65% of households have insufficient liquid assets to subsist at the poverty level for three months in the absence of income. And 50% of the households are unbanked or underbanked. The high rates of households not using banking services increasing the problem of alternative lending services. These lending practices include exorbitant fees and interest rates, misleading terms, and lack of consideration of a borrower’s ability to repay. The wealth and income gaps, in addition to the high rate of unbaked services put women with children at a great disadvantage. &nbsp; In Watsonville, an additional barrier for women is the dependence on low wage agricultural seasonal and service jobs. With limited civic engagement for Latinas elected officials have not addressed their economic and community development strategies an inclusive way to take Latina voices into consideration. Mamas Con Más aims to address this population through culturally appropriate education, outreach, credit building, and advocacy efforts. &nbsp; Santa Cruz Community Ventures (SCCV) is dedicated to promoting social and economic justice through financial capability, asset building, and advocacy. A key strategic focus is Latina women with children in Watsonville. Our goal is to help develop an inclusive economy that works for all. Families deserve equitable opportunities to thrive in their local economies. Lack of financial capability is a foundational block for families to not only understand the financial system, but help be in engaged in key economic planning discussions that are impacting the type of industries in their communities, and through this their earning potential. Educating women empowers families and allows them to navigate through complicated financial spheres and to find their voice in city and county economic development discussions to ensure they have a say in the type of industry, jobs, and businesses in their communities that would support their economic mobility. &nbsp; Mamas Con Más aims to increase use of trusted banking services, increase mother&#8217;s financial capability, avoid or stop the use of alternative banking services, and increase civic engagement in economic planning discussions. One of our approaches to the issue is using financial capability workshops work to educate families around financial topics, to reduce financial stress, increase financial health, and security. By educating mothers, we empower them to confidently navigate through challenging financial networks and make conscious financial decisions. SCCV workshops educate on financial concepts, but allot time to teaching healthy financial behaviors such as banking, saving, budgeting, and managing credit and debt. SCCV also offers credit building lending circle models and combines education about living wages and economic planning into their discussions. &nbsp; We aim to improve community economic stability in the region. 65% of the population is in liquid asset poverty, meaning without sufficient liquid assets to subsist at the poverty level for three months in the absence of income. Additionally, 50% of the households are either unbanked or underbanked. These families cannot afford to use deceptive financial services because they pose a huge risk to their financial health. Families should be making their money work for them, and not paying others unfair fees. &nbsp; &nbsp; Additionally, building awareness around banking services and offering education can change behaviors in families to avoid or stop using alternative banking services. We can measure our impact by leading the conversations around financial services in the community. Our focus is more towards advocacy by encouraging civic engagement. We also work with community leaders and elected officials to share the information to their constituents. Within community leader’s realm of power, we hope to influence community behavior to avoid these services. In addition, we make policy recommendations, &nbsp; &nbsp; Mamas Con Más is valuable to the Latino community because we can educate families to make conscious decisions towards financial services and increase financial security. The more knowledge families obtain the more power they have to make healthy financial decisions. The Latina community faces multiple social and economic challenges. A key project goal is to educate the Latina community to better understand these challenges and give them the tools needed to overcome these barriers. In our community 50% of the population is unbanked or underbanked. By educating around banking services and financial products, we can increase participation. An increase of participation would mean that the use of alternative services will no longer be needed. For example, instead of paying $7 dollars to cash your check at a market, an individual can set up direct deposit to cash their checks for free. Those $7 dollars can now used to buy groceries or placed into a savings account for an emergency. &nbsp; In addition, Mamas Con Más will work to develop advocacy tools and research to education and finlike elected officials in addressing local policies and economic development planning to incorporate Latina voices. &nbsp; For over 25 years, Santa Cruz Community Ventures supports the community by challenging existing systems and building wealth in the community. Last year we offered a forum and toolkit to teach families how to protect their assets in case of deportation. SCCV also served as the fiscal sponsor in a rapid response to fund and support DACA renewals. SCCV is a Latina led and staffed organization where all our financial capability work is led by bilingual and bicultural financial coaches. &nbsp; We will use the funds to pay for staff time, materials, outreach, advocacy, and community organizing around the issue.

Violence prevention is at the core of our work at Centro Mujeres. Sexual violence, the most toxic of its kind, often affects the most vulnerable in our community: children. As parents, mentors, and fellow community members, it is our responsibility to ensure the rights of youth are protected at a young age. OUR WORK At Centro Mujeres, we are committed to preventing sexual violence and abuse in young girls (ages 4-6) through our Little Ones or “Chiquititas” program. This multi-day training teaches children proactive measures and equips them with the effective and assertive skills required to confront dangerous and abusive situations, relationships, and behaviors. As part of a comprehensive approach, Little Ones also sensitizes parents and school staff on identifying and responding to suspected abuse and creating a culture of prevention and zero tolerance. OUR IMPACT Little Ones programming impacts 450 preschool aged children per school year throughout metropolitan communities in the BCS. While the training is preventative, the impact is tangible as cases of sexual violence are often detected or self-disclosed by participating children. In these cases, Centro Mujeres provides follow-up and serves as a bridge between families and public institutions. With your donation, Centro Mujeres will extend this impactful programming to the children of migrant workers. Migrant families, living on the isolated ranches where they work, have extremely limited access to important social services. In most cases of abuse, these social services are vital as patterns are often recognized over a period of time by consistent caregivers and advocates. Moving frequently throughout the year searching for work and economic stability at different moments in the growing season, the children of these migrant workers do not have the benefit of establishing these important relationships. Through Little Ones, children will gain the skills needed to protect themselves. &nbsp; Partner with Centro Mujeres to extend Little Ones and contribute to protecting the most vulnerable and building healthy communities. 100% of donations received will be applied to direct workshop expenses.

However, what few of us know is that a sizable minority of the Latin American immigrant population consists of LGBT refugees seeking asylum because of the violence that they have faced, simply for being open about, or unable to hide their sexual orientation, or gender identity. Take the case of Jorge, who grew up in a small town in Mexico to humble, well-respected parents who were considered pillars of the community.&nbsp; When it became clear that Jorge was different from other boys, his peaceful family life came to an end.&nbsp; Jorge’s father,&nbsp; thinking that he could change his son by being tougher on him, pulled Jorge out of school at age 13 so he could go to work and “learn to be a man.”&nbsp; When this didn’t seem to work, his father began to hurl homophobic insults at him and beat him.&nbsp; When Jorge’s mother tried to defend her son, she would end up getting beaten, herself. Believing that it was the only way to protect his mother, Jorge ran away from home at age 15.&nbsp; He lived on the streets for many years, where he endured not only poverty and hunger, but also the disdain of strangers, who threw rocks at him and insulted him for being gay.&nbsp; At age 20, Jorge was sexually assaulted by a police officer.&nbsp; At that point, he realized that he would probably either kill himself or be killed if he were to remain in Mexico.&nbsp; He made the long, dangerous journey to the U.S., crossing the Arizona desert on foot, eventually making his way to the San Francisco Bay area, where he heard that life was better for LGBT people. During his first few years in the U.S., Jorge struggled with depression.&nbsp; He took walks on the beach, thinking how easy it would be to end it all by just throwing himself into the sea.&nbsp; However, sensing that Jorge was suffering, a friendly co-worker told him about East Bay Sanctuary Covenant (EBSC), a non-profit organization that helps refugees apply for legal asylum at a nominal cost.&nbsp; Jorge made an appointment.&nbsp; There, he was told that in order to apply, he would have to tell his life story, from start to finish.&nbsp; Jorge was afraid.&nbsp; He had never opened up about his life experiences to another living soul, but in the safety of his attorney’s office, with tears streaming down his face, he began to speak. EBSC, our fiscal sponsor and feeder program, sees 300 LGBT refugees each year, each one with a story similar to Jorge’s.&nbsp; For this reason, EBSC decided to sponsor a program called OLAS (Waves), which is a Spanish acronym for LGBT Organization for Support and Solidarity.&nbsp; OLAS offers unique weekend workshops and retreats for LGBT Latin American immigrants and asylum seekers, led by qualified mental health professionals.&nbsp; The events focus on community building and healing from trauma through group support, meditation, and the arts.&nbsp; They are offered at a nominal cost, with no one turned away for lack of funds.",,"2017 Projected Budget &nbsp; In 2016, our actual expenditures were $10,183.91.

For more than 25 years, it has been dedicated to the formal education of Salvadoran children and youth, and since 2011, cultural education has begun, which is in addition to the comprehensive education offered, strengthening the development of our beneficiaries. All this effort is due to Father José María Moratalla Escudero, better known as Father Pepe, a Salesian missionary from Spain, who arrives in El Salvador in the 1980s in the middle of the armed conflict and decides to dedicate his work to this part of our country. Why is it important? The chorus and the Youth Symphony Orchestra has become an alternative for many children and young people who find in music a space of development, formation and occupation of their free time, but always aiming at a formal education. The impact that this project has had on these young people and on the community has been of great magnitude. Art strengthens self-esteem and leads young people to have life goals, having the security they can and deserve a different reality, a better future. The transformation is not only for these children and young people, but also for their families, who in most cases support the talent of their children and become part of this great work. How will the funds be used? $ 5,000 is needed for this project. Proceeds will be used to cover the salary for music teachers, as they are an essential tool for continuing the project of the Youth Symphony Orchestra part. There are 17 teachers with whom we currently have a salary of $ 600.00, we know that the funds requested do not cover what is required by the project, but we are seeking various means to solve it.

She loses her sleep because she has to ask people for help every day so she can have her transportation money and her weekly medication. Rubia is a single mother of 2 children, they live on agricultural work and no family member has a job that generates cash income. One of the children had to stop going to school and cultivate the land in order to be able to accompany his mother both at home and at the hospital. Rubia has knocked on different doors to support her situation, but has not had any positive results to her requests to make her hopeful that she can pay for her treatment. For this reason, as an organization, we are making this campaign to be able to support to Rubia and guarantee her treatment. Although it is a right that should be covered by the state through the ministry of health, those systems have failed. With this campaign we make the call to you who are reading to join and donate for the health of Rubia. How you can help Decide, choose and donate for one of the following needs that Rubia has. $20 you will cover the cost for two visits per week that she makes to the hospital. $140 you will cover her transportation two days a week that she visits the hospital to receive treatment. $46 you will cover the payment for the medication of the two dialysis that she receives weekly. With your donations we will be guaranteeing that Rubia can dedicate herself to take care of her health and forget to worry about the expenses generated by her illness. For this the organization will try to guarantee her transportation, food and weekly treatment costs. &nbsp; About our organization The Organization of Women of Santa Marta works in the promotion and defense of the rights of girls, boys, adolescent women and adults. Our main mission is the promotion, defense and respect of the human rights of women through the formation and accompaniment of processes of empowerment and advocacy for a dignified and full life. It is our first time that we are giving support to specific cases such as Rubia&#8217;s health, because we consider and believe that our struggle is identified with her own. Rubia fights for her life; We fight for the rights of women to enjoy a full and healthy life. We have seen the need to address this case directly from our organization because THE LACK OF RESOURCES FOR THE TREATMENT OF DIALYSIS RISKS THE LIFE OF RUBIA and her health is paramount for us, mainly because we are women with little access to healthcare and we do not receive timely attention.

After four years, she escaped and bravely participated in the criminal case against her trafficker. After receiving a trafficking (T) visa, Monica longed to bring her daughter, Daniela, to New York, but Daniela was being held by the trafficker’s family in Mexico. How could Monica find her daughter, re-gain legal custody in Mexico, and bring her to New York? Monica’s lawyers contacted IMUMI and for two years, the Mexican family law attorney worked with federal Mexican and U.S. officials to locate Daniela, recover physical and legal custody, and re-unite her with her mother. IMUMI provides legal representation to resolve cases such as Monica&#8217;s &#8212; families that have been separated by human trafficking. We have succeeded in reuniting migrant mothers, victims of trafficking, with the children they had to leave behind when they were trafficked from Mexico to the U.S. This involves locating children, filing complex criminal and family law cases to recover custody, and coordination with government authorities, lawyers representing the victims in the U.S., and the mothers who endure the emotional stress of long legal processes. Help us raise funds to continue providing legal representation in cases such as Monica’s. Our goal is to raise USD $5,000 for: 30 % of the annual salary for our Mexican family law attorney; $1,000 for official translations, apostilles and communication costs; $700 for printing legal rights information. Even if we do not reach our goal, the funds raised will be used to pay for the documentation needs of trafficking victims´children such as passports, transportation, apostilles, and official translations. IMUMI is also working on a legal manual for U.S. attorneys that describes Mexican family law procedures and the bi-national legal strategies we have used to address these cases. According to the U.S. Department of State, mexican authorities initiated 188 federal and 288 state investigations in 2016, compared with 250 federal and 415 state investigations for trafficking in 2015. Authorities initiated prosecutions against 479 individuals in federal and state cases in 2016 compared to 578 individuals in federal and state cases in 2015. Mexican authorities reported convicting 228 traffickers involved in 127 federal and state cases in 2016. Human trafficking affects not only the victims, but also their families. Many trafficking survivors identify re-unification with their children as their most pressing concern. Many times they can no longer travel to Mexico due to security or immigration issues, and their children are often in the hands of the trafficker´s family. Re-uniting trafficking victims with their children is fundamental to the emotional recovery of trafficking victims, recognizes the right of children to family life, and prevents trafficking of these children in the future. There are many challenges we face: Impunity: Mexico has a 98% impunity rate for criminal prosecutions which makes it difficult to bring traffickers to justice. Security: Cases are often located in towns known for their high incidence of trafficking and related crimes so IMUMI´s staff must utilize federal protection measures and think about the safety of clients and their children at all times. Restrictive immigration policies in the U.S. often make women more vulnerable to trafficking situations and more afraid to notify local authorities. How does IMUMI ensure that it is prepared to represent these cases? IMUMI staff inlcudes a Mexican Family Law attorney and a U.S. Immigration Attorney who collaborate with trafficking survivors and their lawyers in the U.S. to develop a bi-national legal strategy for each case. In some cases, government agents from Mexico and the U.S. become involved to ensure the safety of the children we seek to re-unite with their mothers. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) also has a program that assists with travel expenses. IMUMI participates in several national and international migration networks, receives and provides training to keep up to date on the issue of human trafficking in Mexico and the U.S. What is the Institute for Women in Migration? IMUMI is a Mexican NGO that advocates for women migrants and their families within the region of Mexico, the U.S. and Central America. We address issues important to migrant women through legal strategies, research, communication, and policy reform. IMUMI´s Legal Clinic represents over 200 women and their families with immigration humanitarian visas, custody issues and access to identity documents each year. Through the clinic, women trafficking survivors are assisted with issues of family re-unification. IMUMI staff understands that migration and human trafficking are often linked. The women we represent often wished to migrate to the U.S. in search of better opportunties for their children only to find themselves in a trafficking situation once arriving. They often lived in poverty, experienced violence and lack of educational opportunties, leaving them vulnerable to false promises of work and love. IMUMI works to understand each person´s situation and believes that re-uniting children with their mothers is an important step to reparation of the harm that they experienced.",,"1.

Educate. Advocate. Represent: The Immigrant Law Center of Minnesota (ILCM) represents immigrants and refugees, in immigration and court proceedings. From Trump&#8217;s inauguration through March 13, immigration arrests in Minnesota and adjoining states jumped by 80 percent over the same time last year. Immigrants who are represented by lawyers win their cases at least twice as often as those who do not have lawyers – and, depending on the type of case, are sometimes four or five times more likely to win. Under U.S. law, someone charged with a misdemeanor who could be punished by three months in jail has a right to a public defender. An immigrant seeking to avoid a deportation for life has no right to a public defender — not if they have lived here for 20 years and have U.S. citizen children, not if they are trying to escape death squads in their home country, not in any case at all. Getting legal services can be a matter of life or death. Educate: Knowing your rights means protecting your family and yourself. Since Trump took office, requests for our Know Your Rights presentations and other legal education trainings have quadrupled. We also offer an immigration helpline, detainee helpline, and an Emergency Preparedness Manual for families. Advocate: Our immigration system has been broken for decades. The current administration&#8217;s actions focus on making that broken system even more punitive and unjust, and stirring up racism and animosity toward immigrants. Right now, we combat this anti-immigrant prejudice as we speak to groups across the state, debunking myths about immigrants and immigration. We respond to specific legislative attacks on immigrants through our action alert hotline, triggering hundreds of calls to legislators on issues like drivers&#8217; licenses and REAL ID. We continue to advocate for comprehensive immigration reform in the long term. All of our offices have a waitlist for services. Especially in today&#8217;s dangerous climate, with ICE arrests increasing and targeting long-time residents, more immigrants and refugees need our help — both in the Twin Cities metro area and in our three offices in Greater Minnesota, where there are limited immigration services.&nbsp; Your gifts will help us build our core legal team, so that we can work with the increasing number of clients who seek to: safeguard their permanent resident status in this country, renew their DACA protection, find safe refuge through the asylum process, apply for legal status for the first time, especially through visas for victims of crime and domestic abuse, become naturalized citizens of the United States, find help with other immigration-related legal issues.

The Escalera STEM Program is based on a rigorous 2-year curriculum for juniors and seniors that supports youth leadership development, promotes a culture of learning and educational excellence, and advances economic mobility through college preparation and career planning. Escalera offers a variety of educational and career-building opportunities that focus on cultivating good scholarship and access to post-secondary education while also preserving cultural identity and enrichment. The program is designed to promote economic mobility among Latino youth by increasing educational attainment, career planning, and access to information about advanced careers in the New Orleans metro area. The primary goals of this program include the following: education/skills development with an emphasis on teaching students how to make knowledgeable decisions in their academic careers and become life-long learners; career pathways/exploration in which students develop skills and viable experience necessary to obtain career opportunities that will enhance their economic mobility; leadership development through community action and engagement; and the development of personal skills that enable youth to be agents of change in their families, communities, and professional lives. These funds will also be used to support the Latinola Now Youth Coalition, a grassroots, multi-racial youth coalition that builds the power and participation of young people working to develop solutions to problems that directly affect them.

We do this through workshops (Rise to the Top), webinars, newsletters, peer mentoring (LV Circles) and coaching. Our focus is to change a statistic that keeps us all up at night: Only 3% of all executives in any sector are Latina. As Latinas grow in number and continue to influence family and community life, we must be seen as more than consumers. The Fortune 500, major nonprofits, universities, and public agencies need Latina executives. The goal of this campaign is to build our nonprofit&#8217;s capacity to produce monthly podcasts (one in English/one in Spanish) where we interview and feature a Latina senior executive. Why LatinaVIDA360 Matters: One of the most important factors that is known to interrupt the career ambitions of Latinas is a sense of isolation, bias and lack of mentors and sponsors. LatinaVIDA360 is an opportunity to show case Latina Trailblazers in every sector who have defied the odds and made it to the top. As Latina are exposed to leaders who are just like them, who faced the same questions as they do now&#8211;this will help many remain focused on their career goals and reach out to find mentors that guide them. LatinaVIDA360 Challenges To Address As with any new venture we must anticipate unexpected technical issues may emerge which is why we have budgeted some time for training on effective podcasting techniques and building an audience for the program. As a team of volunteers, the stipends and support will be essential to make sure we have assistance with the daily outreach efforts that are necessary to build an audience for a program of this kind. However, we fully intend to leverage this campaign to build a large audience and to be featured on other programs like LatinoUSA so that we can be cross promoted.

As you may be aware, I am running Colombia LeadershipBootcamp (CLB) this December 10-17. This is my 2nd pilot towards building Latin American Leadership Academy, an institution that will aim to develop a new generation of better leaders for the region. A fundamental part of our model is that we select the most promising young leaders regardless of their ability to pay, which means that philanthropy has to close the gap. Here’s the cool thing: the students are running crowdfunding campaigns right now in their communities to raise the difference ! If they succeed, not only will we have an exciting innovative funding model, but we will have an incredibly cool story for the larger fundraising we have ahead of us, to build the Academy. Here’s the challenge: they are facing an uphill battle, because many of them come from disadvantaged communities. More importantly, there is still not a strong culture of philanthropic donations in Latin America. Here’s where I need your help: In order to help our students raise the funds they need, and in order to help spur a culture of philanthropic giving in the region, I am building a Matching Fund that will encourage Latin American donors to donate to the kids. Here’s how it would work: If you wish to join us, please make your donation on this page. Our students are trying to raise US$6,000, so your funds will only become “activated” if the students reach certain milestones: If they reach US$3,000, I’ll accept 50% of your donation. I’ll refund you the rest. If they reach US$4,500, I’ll accept 75% of your donation. I’ll refund you the rest. If they reach their US$6,000 target, I’ll accept your full donation. If we raise more funds than we need to run CLB, I’ll inform you. At that point, you’ll have the option to get a refund of the excess, or you can choose to donate that amount for the operational expenses of setting up the Academy (e.g. non-profit incorporation, website development, and so on). Finally, think of the triple leverage of your donation: 1. This fund will help the kids raise more funds from Latin American donors, 2. Their success will help me in my larger fundraising efforts this coming January-June, which I will use to build an institution that will 3. Empower Latin Americans to become change-makers in their own communities. I can’t think of a higher leverage donation you can make today ?

Of what use is an educated Hispanic female? Of what use is an educated and morally strong Hispanic female? Her use is unfathomable and vital to not only herself and her family but to all of society. We have so many examples of just such women, from a Supreme Court Justice to heads of companies and to all walks of professional life. In order for this to happen today, our young women must have a strong and excellent foundation. This is what happens at the Nora Cronin Presentation Academy, a small yet powerful school, in Newburgh, New York. The Nora Cronin Presentation Academy is a middle school, grades five to eight, whose students come from low-income families. The academy is a holistic environment that affirms the values of faith, hope, justice and freedom in an environment that fosters human dignity. It calls the students to a kinship of care for the Earth, to foster peace and to give back to their communities. In order to do this effectively classes are kept to fifteen girls in a class. The size of the school encourages strong bonds of kindness and acceptance of each other. With this feeling of belonging the girls feel free to express themselves as well as develop at their own rate. The school is blessed in so many ways: A principal and staff who is dedicated to the mission of the school. A principal who offers strong leadership and teachers who not only instruct during the school day but offer individual help when needed are strongly caring of each child in their care. No child’s needs are ignored whether they are educational or personal. Parents whose involvement is most important to the well-being of their child. In fact in order to keep the building in good order, parents donate all paper goods and take turns cleaning the school. This sweat equity keeps costs down and is done in lieu of tuition. Parents are very grateful that their girls are in a safe environment at little to no cost to them. Volunteers who allow the school day to be extended with many types of programs such as computer skills, leadership training and self-esteem workshops being just a few. A four-week summer program expands the horizons of our young ladies with field trips outside of their local areas as well as opportunities to do community service. A Board of Directors who believes strongly in the mission of the school and work to keep it financially viable. Donors who generously support the work of the school because they believe in its mission. The Nora Cronin Presentation Academy is a school filled with eager and smart Hispanic young girls who will someday become our leaders. The school is truly the product of hard-work and dedication by all involved and is truly a gift the community.",,,,,ended,,,

With your support we can grow our organization and support more leaders in 2018. The Latino Political Network is a candidate for a major grant that will allow us to hire our first full-time organizer. The organization has been volunteer-led since it was created in 2015. If we get the grant, we will still need resources to implement our trainings and continue to build strong connections between our members across Iowa. Why it matters: Across the country the Latino community is underrepresented in elective office. We need public servants to step up and run for local, state and national offices. And with much of the harshest rhetoric pointed at Latino Americans, we need more Latinos to run for public office. For many Latinos the network, skills, and confidence needed for a successful campaign are all lacking. Prior to launching the LPN in 2015, there was no organization in Iowa focused on empowering and educating Latinos to serve in elected office. Iowa is a state with a rapidly-growing and young Latino population that lacks wealth, power, and status. The lack of civic and political power has a direct negative impact on the development of the Latino community. We founded this organization two years ago and have run it in our spare time because we believe in the mission and we know we are the right people to inspire a new generation of Latino leaders. Each of us has worked for a United States Senator and Rob is the first Latino to win an election in Des Moines, Iowa&#8217;s largest county. We have the knowledge and passion to train and inspire more Latino leaders in Iowa. The LPN has held trainings all across Iowa. At each event we focus on what is necessary to run a successful campaign and build community between everyone in attendance. At our first event six Latinos announced their campaigns for local office! 2018 is going to be a big year for the Latino Political Network. We are a finalist for a grant to hire our first organizer. We are asking for your support for program funding to assist them as they continue to build relationships and set up trainings across Iowa. All of our trainings are free to the public. We travel across the state to make sure travel is not a barrier for a participant. And we always provide food. Because nothing brings our community together like sharing a hot meal! Potential Challenges: The Latino Political Network is a 501c3 and is completely non-partisan. We founded this organization so that the Latino community would have advocates who put the needs of our families before party or candidate. But by choosing not to align with the parties we have closed off some avenues of support. And many people just see Iowa as a fly-over state with no Latino population. That is just not true. There are over 180,000 Latinos living in Iowa. And the median age of the Latino population is 15 years younger than the rest of the state! If you donate to the LPN, your donation will cover the cost of our trainings all across the state. It will pay for food for our participants and gas for our organizer. We are also revamping our website to make it a home for our network members to support each other and for the political world to meet the Iowa Latino officeholders. Other Ways to Help: You do not have to donate to the LPN to help. Please share our campaign with your networks. If you are in Iowa, you can help us reach more people that we could work with. If you are outside of Iowa, you can help us connect with other individuals and organizations that are doing similar work. Our long-term vision for the LPN is an organization funded by an army of average people who believe in our work. Please help share this campaign among your friends, family, and associates. &nbsp;",,,,,ended,,lpniowa,

A Safe Place has seen the number of Hispanic clients served grow over the past 10 years; over 29% of the clients served in 2014-15 were Hispanic. Serving this population is critical in Lake County. Because of the growth in the Latino community, it is important for domestic violence services provided in our area to include programs specifically appropriate to the Latino population, particularly those who are not fluent in English. To meet the increasing demand of domestic violence services in the Hispanic community, A Safe Place created the La Paloma program to more appropriately meet the needs of Latino victims. The program has its own coordinator and will bring all Latino programs under one umbrella. &nbsp; The majority of victims served by A Safe Place are low income, which often creates a barrier for victims wanting help. A Safe Place removes multiple barriers for survivors of domestic violence and their children needing services. A Safe Place provides counseling services to survivors of domestic violence and their children at no cost and in multiple locations throughout Lake County, making our services affordable and accessible. With the La Paloma program, A Safe Place can more appropriately meet the needs of Latino victims by providing services in the language they are most comfortable in. Our counseling programs use best practices established by domestic violence coalitions. A Safe Place refers clients to other local agencies for other health and mental health services we are unable to provide. Funding will help A Safe Place improve the mental health of hundreds of survivors of domestic violence. It would also help A Safe Place save hundreds of lives and thousands of dollars in medical costs and lost productivity while allowing survivors of domestic violence to rebuild their lives. &nbsp; ASP’s Counseling Program provides individual and family counseling, support groups, art therapy, and support services to adults and children. Counseling services are provided throughout Lake County. To make services accessible to all, counseling is provided for free to survivors and their children, in both English and in Spanish. &nbsp; Counseling helps survivors recognize their own strength and self worth, breaking the cycle of power and control that has dominated their lives. Safety and crisis-focused counseling come first in the treatment received. Clients are assessed in regards to their overall life history as well as the history of their abusive relationship(s). Support and validation of the survivor’s feelings and thoughts are crucial. Most abusers slowly convince survivors that their thoughts or opinions are wrong which creates self doubt within survivors and leads them to question their ability to live independently. Reestablishing a survivor’s sense of trust and boundaries are also focus points of counseling. Counselors and clients create service plans, identifying therapeutic and safety-related goals along with the steps that can be taken to reach those goals. In addition to providing counseling, The La Paloma Program offers assistance in Latina issues such as immigration and better understandings of the right of victims under the law. &nbsp; Since 1980, A Safe Place has been providing services for victims of domestic violence and their children.&nbsp;The counselors and advocates engaged in providing victim services possess the educational background, training and relevant experience necessary to provide quality counseling and supportive services to victims and witnesses of domestic violence. &nbsp;",,,,,ended,,,

The Assembly determined that it will be held in 2003, close to February 12, the day of the youth. Likewise at a meeting of the National Coordination of Youth Ministry it was suggested that the meeting also promote the proposal of the Venezuelan Plenary Council for young people. Likewise, the proposal was presented to Bishop Mariano José Parra Sandoval, President of the Episcopal Commission for Youth and University Pastoral Ministry during the Bishops&#8217; Assembly of October 2001 and to his brothers in the episcopate in plenary, who expressed their support for it. The events developed in our country in the political, social and economic fields forced to rethink the realization of the National Encounter, a situation that made us think that it should not be done, but convinced that young Venezolanos are anxious to meet us and demonstrate to all that through our faith and our forces want and can build a people of brothers, the Meeting was set for the end of the year. In this opportunity will be held the fourth edition of the Enajó from August 1 to 5, 2018, and convinced that this meeting is a great support and strengthening of all young Venezolanos, builders of a new society.

This course is specifically requested by our Advisory Council, and addresses a need that is well known throughout their communities, as this remote area has lost its native language due to the Spanish-only government schools. A tri-lingual indigenous elder, Elsa Carpio (pictured) has volunteered to relocate to a remote region, far away from her grandchildren, in order to revive her language in villages where it has been lost.

Recent policy changes have accelerated detention and deportation activities, deepened the immigration enforcement authority of sheriffs and police officers, expanded those targeted for deportation, prioritized for deportation anyone convicted of a crime, even minor offenses and putting in high risk two important immigrant groups that were safeguarded. Our community is in the middle of an immense immigration disaster, and we need to help them: • In fact, the arrests of undocumented immigrants without criminal records have risen more than 150% in 2017. Between January 22 and April 29, ICE conducted around 10,800 “non-criminal arrests,” compared to just 4,200 in 2016. ICE has picked up immigrants at courthouses, at church shelters, and at hospitals while their children underwent surgery. • In the coming months, 648,430 Latino Dreamers, most between 16 and 25 years old, will lose the ability to work legally in the US and their protection from deportation due to the elimination of DACA if the Congress does not act immediately. • In addition, the future of 300,000 Central American immigrants with TPS ,who are parents to US Citizen children and have an average of 20 years living in the United States, is still unknown. • 2,500 Nicaraguan immigrants will have to return to their home country, due to the elimination of their Temporary Protected Status “TPS” • The Enhancing Public Safety in the Interior of U.S executive order was signed to defund and invalidate sanctuary cities. Some fear falling victim to misinformation from individuals, hearsay, and notaries. Community members have expressed a preference to receive information and support from a known and reputable source. For some low-income immigrant families, the cost of accessing affordable immigration legal assistance serves as a barrier to securing their legal status. The solution: To protect our community from the impact of changing legislation and possible deportation, violation of rights, isolation, harassment, discrimination, or further insecurity, El Centro Hispano is creating an affordable immigration legal assistance service for low-income Latino families and engaging community members as advocates, mobilizers, and organizers for more welcoming and inclusive immigration policies at the local, state, and national levels. El Centro Hispano has hired a full time immigration lawyer and will hire one accredited representative for the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) and a paralegal to serve as staff to the new immigration legal program. This will strengthen and expand the legal team and network of existing lawyers. We intend to accelerate the process of assessing the legal status and possibilities of individual cases to expedite tracking them toward citizenship and/or making plans to prepare themselves and their families with the information and resources they need immediately to make decisions or plans. In addition, ECH will continue mobilizing community members, immigrant-service groups, lawyers, law students, and others to assist with outreach, education, and community mobilization; helping to organize Know Your Rights forums, ID drives, and power of attorney clinics. During this year, more than 2,500 Latino immigrants at risk have attended these three initiatives. Community members will be trained as advocates to meet with key decision-makers and agency heads to educate on recent immigration policies and discuss how they can remain inclusive and welcoming of immigrant communities and to stand alongside immigrants to speak up against anti-immigrant/anti-Latino laws, policies, and rhetoric. Our commitment: With your generous support we are committed to achieve the following Goals and Outcomes: 1) Make available affordable immigration legal services and information on rights through a legal team made up of immigration lawyer, a BIA accredited representative, a coordinator, a paralegal, and advocates to protect community members from victimization, violation of rights, deportation, and harassment. 2) Our legal team will assist with intake, conduct screenings for immigration relief, help assist with forms to USCIS, and provide immigration legal assistance to at least 100 individuals in need of affordable service. 3) Mobilize community members in education, outreach and advocacy efforts to lift the voice of immigrant communities and engage immigrants along with allies against anti-immigrant, anti-Latino policies and rhetoric. 4) As part of our education, outreach and mobilization efforts, ECH will hold at least ten (10) new “Know Your Rights” forums and ten (10) “Power of Attorney” clinics; ten (10) Faith ID Drives; four (4) “No Operator” Civic classes to empower immigrant groups with information and resources to help respond to changing policies and environments. 5) At least 15 individuals will participate in advocacy training and meet with key local and state decision-makers to educate about current immigration laws and policies and make recommendations for improvements. 6) Continue with our citizenship classes in Durham and Carrboro-Chapel Hill which have allowed more than 25 immigrants become a new citizen in the last few months. &nbsp;",,,,,ended,,,

FOR 9 OUT OF 10 CHILDREN BORN WITH A CLEFT CONDITION, THIS CAN LEAD TO DEATH. AT OPERATION SMILE WE BELIEVE THAT EVERY CHILD DESERVES EXCEPTIONAL SURGICAL CARE. WE BELIEVE ALL CHILDREN DESERVE TO BE TREATED AS IF THEY WERE OUR OWN. THAT’S WHAT DRIVES EACH AND EVERY ONE OF US: OUR GLOBAL NETWORK OF MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS, WHO DONATE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF HOURS TOWARD THE CARE OF CHILDREN AROUND THE WORLD EACH YEAR, AND OUR SUPPORTERS WHO ARE MOVED EVERY DAY TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THE LIVES OF CHILDREN THEY’VE NEVER MET. HOW YOU CAN HELP HERE IN GUATEMALA, IT IS OUR GOAL TO SPEND THIS HOLIDAY SEASON GIVING BACK. WE HOPE TO RAISE ENOUGH MONEY TO PROVIDE 11 CHILDREN WITH LIFE-SAVING SURGERIES IN MAY 2019. EACH SURGERY IS JUST $260, AND IF YOU DONATE TO OUR CAUSE, WE WILL BE ONE STEP CLOSER TO PROVIDING CHILDREN WITH NEW SMILES.

He wants to be a lawyer when he grows up. He works hard to turn in a research paper that must be typed and researched on a computer, but he has to pay to use the computer. His father is a textile weaver and doesn’t earn enough to pay for Juan’s school expenses. His parents only finished elementary school and cannot help him with his schoolwork. Juan told us his story … he has a powerful voice and a big heart. We can’t let money interfere with his future and be the reason he decides to migrate. We dream of a Guatemala in which indigenous children and adolescents have access to a comprehensive, quality education and are not forced to migrate. That is, that conditions exist so that they can grow up healthy, educated, and carry out their dreams in the place where they were born. However, the poverty and lack of health services, education, and employment that characterize many Guatemalan communities, many boys, girls, and adolescents are forced to make the decision to migrate in an attempt to survive. Our LED (Leadership, Education, &amp; Development) project’s main goal is to strengthen the capacities of indigenous maya-k’iche’ boys, girls and adolescents living in Chuatroj Guatemala in ways that help break the cycle of migration. To achieve this goal, we work with Chuatroj’s most economically and socially vulnerable families in the form of a scholarship program targeting their school-age children (7-17 years old). The scholarship provides each student with a monthly financial stipend destined to cover 100% of their school fees and contribute to other personal needs such healthcare, clothing, and food. In an effort to promote a culture of savings, the families deposit 5% of the scholarship in a savings account for the student at the village co-op “El Progreso R.L.”. With the help of LED program volunteers, we conduct home-visits with our students in order to follow-up with their well-being and academic progress. We also organize extra-curricular activities in collaboration with the local school in order to help build self-esteem and encourage them to imagine that another future is possible. Our LED project is carried out in collaboration with our team at INCEDES, a committee of local educators, community elders, the local co-op, and your support. Each scholarship has a value of $360.00 and every donation -big and small- helps us to work towards our goal. With your help you will be giving a boy or girl the opportunity to attend school and grow-up in the place he or she was born! OUR PROGRAM IS DOUBLE THE IMPACT AT THE INDIVIDUAL AND FAMILY LEVEL: Our program Targets girls and teenagers whose precarious economic, family, and community situation makes them highly vulnerable to dropping out of school, child labor, early marriage/pregnancy, and a lifetime of chronic illness, malnutrition, and extreme poverty. Our project lessens the impact of this situation on our students’ (and their families’) future and mitigates the pressure to migrate by providing them this educational opportunity and a minimum basic financial support. Fosters a culture that prioritizes a child’s right to schooling and involves parents in their child’s academic success. This is especially important in Guatemala where indigenous girls are systematically excluded from schooling due to cultural beliefs about traditional gender roles and the right of women to study. Allows impoverished families to gain experience of regular finances and introduces a saving mentality (as opposed to relying on their seasonal farming to live). As many of our families are single-mother homes, our project contributes to improved financial literacy and autonomy among women. Raises elementary (and soon secondary) school completion rates among Mayan children; Has the potential to increase the number of Mayan youth who pursue a university degree; Has the potential to increase the number of Mayan’ children who have access to healthcare during their critical growth period. AT THE COMMUNITY LEVEL: Our program Contributes to building a self-sufficient, organized, healthy village in the absence of support from the central government; Strengthens local capacities to collectively propose, implement, and administer projects directed at fomenting self-sufficiency and improving quality of life. We have established a quantitative baseline of requirements for scholars currently in the program, which allows us to measure improvements in grades and attendance over the course of their school career. We also conduct bi-annual evaluation meetings with Committee members and students to discuss students’ personal and academic progress and generate ideas for improving our impact. We are currently improving on defining measures to monitor living conditions and to provide greater support for mothers.",,"Rubros de pago / Payment items Total Anual / Annual Amount (USD$) Fondo de becas / Scholarship fund &#8211; 24 becas $ 8.640,00 Aporte para la operación comunitaria del Comité de Becas en Chuatroj / Community contribution to the Scholarship Committee operation in Chuatroj $ 100,00 3 visitas de campo a Chuatroj para trabajo con los estudiantes becados y documentación de avances / 3 field visits to Chuatroj for workshops with students and documenting progress $ 450,00 Comunicación y materiales del proyecto / Communications and project material $ 200,00 Gastos administrativos y recursos humanos (Aporte de 10% a la administración de INCEDES) / Administrative expenses and human resources (10% contribution to administation to INCEDES) $ 939,00 Total $ 10.329,00",,,ended,,LED_Guatemala,

He was receiving a certificate of completion from the HACAN-sponsored Leer+ summer program. “I feel like crying! I am so happy!” Maynor,&nbsp; a rambunctious and athletic little guy who likes soccer but hadn’t been too keen on school, had been recommended to Leer+ by the vice principal of Bailey’s Primary School, Ted Cooper. He and 28 others who were slightly below benchmark on their end-of-year kindergarten assessments were attending our program with a parent or older sibling. After two sessions with Leer+, Maynor had become very excited with the realization that he was grasping phonics concepts that were propelling him toward fluent reading. “I love books! I love reading!” he exclaimed as we were wrapping up the session. &nbsp; Maynor’s older brother Ismael was proud, too. Because Leer+ requires participation from a parent or older sibling, along with the child, Ismael was learning effective and efficient decoding strategies that would help his brother read. Having arrived from Honduras only two years before, as an English language learner (ELL) Ismael was also directly benefitting from Leer+, &nbsp; Leer + is now well into the academic school year session for these children and their parents. Every Wednesday and Thursday after school, we meet in the Clubhouse, parents and first-graders, ready to learn strategies for becoming fluent book lovers. Most of our adult participants don’t speak English. They are just as eager for the opportunity to learn to speak and read in English as they are to support the literacy of their children at home—an idea that once seemed impossible is becoming a reality. &nbsp; A crucial part of our Leer+ is the Speak Up/Be Safe program. Because learning cannot happen successfully when families are threatened by physical and/or mental abuses that often appear in communities that are stressed by poverty and overcrowding, Leer+ wants to make sure that our families know how to create and maintain a safe home. We teach them body and mental health safety; and, because we develop a trusting relationship with our families, we can match them other services that will best ensure their safety and security. By so doing, we can be sure our families are ready to learn. &nbsp; Please help us reach our goal of $10,000 dollars. Any amount you can donate and/or any time you can spend spreading the word about our campaign among your friends and family will be helping us successfully complete the pilot year of our Leer+ program. Maynor and Ismael and all our other families have made so much progress and we want to continue to support them to reach their highest potential.&nbsp;",,"Funding of Leer Plus from December 15, 2017 to June 30, 2018 Personnel &nbsp;Director:&nbsp; $20.00 per hour x 32 hours per week x 26 weeks&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$16,640 Support worker: $16.00 per hr. x 10 hours per week x26 weeks&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$4160 10 Tutors: $16.00 per hr. x 4 hours per week x 26 weeks ($1664) Non-volunteers $1664 x 10 tutors&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $16,640 Stipends, gift certificates to tutors, volunteers Total:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;$41,000 Non Personnel &nbsp;Copies, materials for program etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$4000 Proyector, other materials&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$1,000 Snacks,&nbsp; food for celebrations&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$ 1000 Total: $23,640&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Kind&nbsp;&nbsp; $20,800",,,ended,,,

She had dreams and a life ahead of her. She loved her little children, worked from sun to sun and was the only bread-winner in her home. However, something was not right with her life. José, her ex-partner, did not leave her alone. From before separating, he mistreated her and beat her. She left him but that did not stop him from continuing to threaten her. Feeling desperate, she put the complaint in the National Police, but they did not give her the necessary protection. Shortly afterwards, José chased her, ambushed her and killed her. He coldly calculated everything. José is currently fugitive of justice and Juana’s three little children were left unprotected and orphaned. In Nicaragua, 126 women were victims of femicide between 2014 and 2015. They died in the hands of men who assumed they had the right to take their lives just because they were their partners, ex-partners or because they had an intimate relationship with them. Like Juana, most of these women had reported the mistreatment and violence they suffered, but very few received effective help. Like Juana, the victims were mothers, daughters, workers and supported at least five people in their homes. The killers not only took their lives away from them, but also left their families unprotected and psychologically traumatized. These families did not receive any services nor support from the State institutions, because in Nicaragua there are no programs or policies to support the victims. Every woman&#8217;s life counts: knowing the stories and circumstances of their deaths, we can help save the lives of thousands of women in Nicaragua. &nbsp; How will we put your donations into action? Our goal to reactivate the observatory with the minimum staff required is USD5,000.00. This will allow us to operate for a year and produce 3 quarterly reports and an annual report with femicides’ data and findings. The reports will also serve as inputs for future education and awareness materials. The Observatory will be managed by a team of experts in media registration and monitoring, who specialize in human rights and in the production of educational materials, and who also have the sensibility to rescue the human dimension of both the victim and the killer, thus being able to show the life circumstances behind the statistical data. In addition, we will count on the voluntary work of experts on care and prevention of violence against women, who will review and approve the Observatory publications. &nbsp; Why it matters: With a renewed and reactivated Observatory we will not only provide figures or statistical data on femicides, we will also do research work to spread the victims’ stories. We will analyze their cases, the circumstances of the crime, the social and cultural factors that intervened in the problem, and provide clues so that people can recognize attitudes, behaviors and circumstances that represent warning signs. In addition, the Observatory will provide inputs to influence justice operators, to demand public policies and the correct application of the law, to support survivors and victims’ relatives, and to sensitize and educate the general public. Our reward will be the satisfaction of contributing to a culture free of violence in Nicaragua, where we women can enjoy our rights, especially the right to life and to live free of violence. &nbsp; Potential Challenges: In the case that we can´t raise USD5,000,00 we will continue to seek more funding from other sources to complete the goal and reactivate the Observatory, because it is a necessary and urgent tool to prevent more deaths of women in Nicaragua. Your support is essential, not only as a donor, but also as a volunteer, ambassador and promoter of the campaign. Make this campaign yours and help us spread it to save the lives of women! You can use Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, Messenger, email and even a phone call to share the campaing. Remember to tell your friends, family and contacts why it is urgent to support this cause, and also provide the link of this campaign to make a donation. Together we can achieve the goal! &nbsp; About our organization: We are the Network of Women against Violence (RMCV in Spanish), a space of articulation made up of women and organizations from several municipalities and departments of Nicaragua. For 25 years we the Network have saved women’s lives and supported thousands of women to free themselves from violence. As part of our mission, in 2005 we launched the National Femicide Observatory, a platform to record all cases of femicides and femicides in a degree of frustration (that is, when the woman survives), based on monitoring print and digital media. However, in 2015 we had to close the observatory due to lack of funding. We now consider urgent to reactivate it because in Nicaragua femicides go from bad to worse. With your support we will be able to reactivate and renew the Observatory to prevent femicides and demand justice!",,,,,ended,,,

This is a big goal, so every contribution is extremely valuable. &nbsp; It is important to mention that the construction of the houses will be carried out according to the needs and interests of the affected families, with the intention of creating hospitable spaces, sensative customs of the communities. &nbsp; It is necessary to specify that the communities will work together on the actual construction of their homes in order to promote empowerment of the participants. &nbsp; We are committed to having the contributions go directly to the affected families. &nbsp; Adequate housing and a decent life is a human right, to which all people deserve access. Collaborating in this reconstruction project will allow many families to obtain this right as well as strengthen their community’s social fabric. &nbsp; With your contribution we will impact the quality of life of 1725 people who will recover their houses and 400 people who will benefit from the construction of the 2 community centers. Indirectly it will benefit more than a thousand people. &nbsp; Over its 21 years of community partnership Fundación Comunidad A.C. has worked in numerous regions of Morelos supporting thousands of people in various ways. It has supported the strengthening of community and donor networks to support projects that have a positive impact on thousands of families. &nbsp; We know that the challenge is great, but we trust in the goodwill of the people. &nbsp; Your contribution is very valuable, as we will not only rebuild houses but community networks!

In Caribbean Guatemala, FUNDAECO&#8217;s &#8220;Healthy and Empowered Women and Girls&#8221; program collaborates with rural women and midwives to operate a network of 21 clinics and 9 community botiquines (small community-run supply posts) to ensure that young people and women living in remote, environmentally-protected areas have access to culturally-sensitive health services and comprehensive sexual and reproductive health services. We also work to empower young women through advanced education and leadership opportunities, as well as opportunities for alternative economic development, designed and developed by women in their communities.&nbsp; &nbsp;[Spanish version here: https://hipgive.org/es/project/healthy-and-empowered-women-and-girls/ ] Women&#8217;s sexual and reproductive health and environmental problems are interconnected. As mothers and providers of family care, women are most affected by environmental degradation, and their health and well-being is vital to the success of sustainable development and biodiversity conservation efforts. Environmental degradation directly impacts quality of life for local populations, particularly for rural women. Generally, in areas where the quality of air, water and land is more degraded, women’s health and rights suffer. FUNDAECO approaches conservation from a rights perspective. We believe that people – particularly women (girls, teenagers and adults) – must recognize their sexual and reproductive rights as fundamental human rights so they can be empowered and plan for their futures. Strengthening those rights will generate positive outcomes for environmental and natural resources conservation efforts in the medium and long-term. In addition, healthy and empowered rural women will play a leading role in promoting environmental sustainability within their communities. The &#8220;Healthy and Empowered Women and Girls&#8221; program includes the following strategic focuses… Women’s Human Rights Natural Resources Conservation and Management Gender Cultural Relevance …and the following intervention models: Sexual and Reproductive Health Services Women&#8217;s Formal Education Informal Education Based on Women’s Human Rights Rural Entrepreneurship and Productivity ABOUT US&nbsp; Founded in 1990, FUNDAECO is a Guatemalan environmental NGO which promotes the establishment of protected areas and their participatory governance; fosters sustainable economic activities for communities; and promotes the protection of biodiversity through biological research and monitoring, environmental education and policy advocacy.

Unfortunately, the inequality brings poverty and lack of opportunities for development. One problem faced by underpriviledged groups is access to health services, as they often &#8220;fail&#8221; to be covered by free health services.To face this problem, foundation Los Pilares de la Familia has designed a Health Day to provide medical care and dental care to the people in need which includes both adults and children. In addition to providing them with adequate treatment, there will also be workshops focused on topics such as alcoholism, self-esteem and a school for parents. This to give members of the community tools that allow them to have a physically and emotionally healthy lifestyle which in turn supports their human development. There are also a program of values ​​called &#8220;Hidden Treasures&#8221; that will be given to children through games and manual activities that allow them to develop and interact correctly with their environment. How will we put your donations into action? To execute this program, we need an approximate of $40,000 for the purchase of the material that is needed for the medical and dental care, as well as for the medicines that people need according to the treatment assigned by the doctors in charge&nbsp;With the help of some doctors, we made a list of medicines which is required for the most common diseases. Among the medicines are analgesics, antibiotics, antiparasitic, antitussives, bronchodilators, antispasmodics, antimitotic, vitamins, antacids, antihistaminic and products of hygiene and dental treatment.&nbsp;In any case of not achieving the goal set, we would focus on covering the material that dentists need, since the material is necessary to be able to examine the patients.&nbsp; Why does it matter: We consider that health is one of the main factors for the development of the human body, as well as important part of the quality of life. Therefore, it is necessary to meet immediate needs to provide help to people who are surrounded by poverty and can not afford it themselves, so that in turn they can take a step towards their very own development and at the same time contribute to the development of their community. Potential challenges: We are conscious about the economic, social and cultural difficulty that exists to execute these kind of programs, but the external and internal volunteers for the community made it possible for the Foundation Los Pilares de la Familia A.C to host programs like these and help more families in need.

Literacy can help!","Every day in El Salvador, youth must navigate a country dominated by violence and insecurity. Finding comfort and refuge in books, using writing for expression of pain, joy, identity and learning… these are tools all youth need not only to survive, but to thrive. In the homicide capital of the world, literacy is a tool to combat violence: youth learn about worlds beyond their own and the power they have to write their future. Becoming authors of their own stories helps them create new identities independent of the cycles of violence and poverty. Reading and writing are not just academic skills&#8211;they are life skills that make youth better thinkers and listeners, better able to make sense of complicated surroundings. In dangerous terrain, books and story and language, well-facilitated conversations and safe-spaces in schools create lasting refuge. Why it matters: ConTextos works with youth from “war zone” neighborhoods. We know that violence is a cycle in which victimization begets victimization. That’s why we train teachers to create spaces of refuge for children and write with youth affected by violence to begin the process of healing past traumas. Reading and writing are our tools to prevent violence through the development of critical thinking and empathy. Our programs show how reading and writing make youth youth into better people, with increased tolerance, expression and life-projection. Potential Challenges: Violence in El Salvador has many causes, often an expression of historic repression, conflict and poverty. In this environment, reading and writing are not a panacea. Creating a more peaceful future requires the cooperation of many institutions. While we work to ensure quality education and rehabilitation for youth, we make conscious alliances with other institutions and organizations to work towards change from various sectors. &nbsp; How we’ll put your donations to work: We will dedicate funds towards the costs of publishing illustrated memoirs written by Salvadoran youth. This work requires tremendous care on the part of teachers and attention to detail so that youth publish a truly authentic story that they can be proud of.

Your parents tell you it is your fault for acting that way. The police see you kissing another girl in the park and they haul you off and threaten to kill you if they ever catch you with a girl again. You realize that if you stay in Mexico you will be killed and so you flee to the United States. You come to live in California.

Every morning, you live in fear that ICE will have you deported to the country where you fear death. These are Oasis clients&#8217; stories.

Jorli, pictured here with her son, is one of our clients who has won asylum. In Mexico, Jorli suffered humiliation and violence for being lesbian. She fled to the US when she was 26. Her son Joseph was born here and is now in fourth grade. Before getting asylum, Jorli was always worried that she would be detained by ICE and there would be no one to pick Joseph up from school. Now that she feels safe, Jorli no longer fears going out in public with her son, and they recently realized their long-time dream of going to a Giants game together. &#8220;Working with Oasis staff has changed my life, making me feel more safe and like I can be myself.&#8221; &#8211; Jorli Your donation today is instrumental in protecting a life. $2500 is the cost to Oasis for obtaining asylum and giving legal guidance to one LGBTQ immigrant fleeing violence.

They lack access to education, face discrimination, and are more likely to live in poverty than non-Mayan girls &#8211; factors which drive child marriage. &nbsp; Child marriage limits opportunities for girls. It increases their risk of domestic violence and complications during child birth, while perpetuating the cycles of intergenerational poverty and gender inequality. But we’re breaking these cycles! &nbsp; Women’s Justice Initiative (WJI) empowers Mayan girls and women to delay child marriage and access a broader range of opportunities to to build brighter futures in Guatemala. &nbsp; We equip Mayan girls ages 10 to 17 with the skills and knowledge to advocate for themselves through our Girls’ Empowerment, Rights, and Leadership course. Our empowerment workshops are delivered in Kaqchikel, the local Mayan language, and focus on: gender equality and rights, delaying marriage, preventing violence against women and girls, leadership and self-esteem, goal setting, and sexual and reproductive health. &nbsp; We also train Mayan women and engage community leaders to prevent child marriage and promote gender equality. &nbsp; Empowering Mayan girls and women is fundamental to preventing child marriage and breaking the cycles of gender inequality in Guatemala.

We want to improve those experiences by fundamentally changing the quality of healthcare by making patient safety a priority. Improving the quality of pediatric care delivered to some of our smallest patients requires embracing organizational change to help reduce errors. The economic impact on society of unsafe health care and medical errors is substantial, through lost days of work and higher long term health care costs, all of which ultimately contribute to poverty. For children in particular, lack of access to high quality health care can lead to a worsening of health, which, in turn, can negatively impact their ability to attend school, social interaction, and quality of life. Patient safety works should be built into healthcare delivery. This requires effort to establish a culture of patient safety through organizational infrastructure, engaging leadership and frontline staff, promoting efficient teamwork to identify and mitigate errors, and providing quality and safety training. All of these efforts are centered around and reducing preventable harm and improving patient outcomes. To address this need, the Pediatric Nephrology Unit at Roosevelt Hospital and Duke University Medical Center have partnered to address patient safety. This initiative is unique because it moves beyond addressing a single disease, but instead, expands horizontally to strengthen the safe delivery of care across all types of diseases and medical disciplines. Our training program will focus on building capacity in safety science, quality improvement, and implementation science in Roosevelt Hospital in Guatemala City. This program will leverage the collective experience at Duke University Medical Center in patient safety and quality improvement with complementary expertise in implementation science to address these challenges. The long-term goal of this program is to establish a core team in patient safety, quality improvement, and implementation sciences in Guatemala whose members have the skills to serve as leaders in their home countries for health care safety and quality.",,,,,ended,,InfoFundegua,

The project began as a humanitarian response by Dr. Ortiz Orellana to her sensitivity of observing the children attended at the Medical Care Unit from. These children do not live within reach of the medical center, and they have to travel for up to 2 hours to reach their medical appointment on time. Due to the high demand of patients, mothers must arrive early in the morning to get their child´s care, and for this reason children arrive on a fasting visit. In view of this situation and the severe malnutrition of many of the children, Dr Mildred started with her own funds the project of providing a glass of milk with fortified flour to all the children who attend their medical appointment &#8211; up to 75 children a day. In addition the children could not receive any medicine with their empty belly. As the number of children benefited grew, its costs were increasing and she has been forced to seek for funding or donations. And with the generous donation of many poeple she has been able to provide with a bread with beans, and a sweet pastry in addition to the glass of milk. Why is it important? The impact of the project has been surprising. Mothers have learned how vital it is to improve habits to keep a child healthy, also they have become aware of the importance of nutritional values in children&#8217;s health. Listening to Dr. Mildred on how to combat malnutrition, mothers have improved feeding practices for their children. This has resulted in an overall health improvement of the children. How will the funds be used? Our goal is to reach $3,500 to feed 24,000 children a year (100 children a day from Monday to Friday for a year) at a cost of 14.5 cents per child, providing a glass of milk with fortified flour and bread with beans. Monthly, the total cost to feed an average of 2000 children per month amounts to $ 292 per month.",,,,,ended,,,https://vimeo.com/210687395

Every cent you donate toward our $25,000 goal will directly fund educator and student organizing projects designed by our teams to build positive communities and transform school culture. Teachers Unite members are public school educators working to promote positive school culture that embodies Transformative Justice through its practice (circles, alternatives to suspensions, anti-racist pedagogy, etc.) and its principles including: collective action, community accountability, resistance to unjust institutions, respect for all voices, and transformation through struggle. We want police, arrests and metal detectors out of schools, because we want schools that foster education and loving inclusivity, not punishment and fear. Teachers Unite is the only membership organization of New York City public school educators who are resisting their roles in what is known as the School to Prison Pipeline. The School to Prison Pipeline includes the overuse of suspensions, zero tolerance policies that involve the police in minor incidents, and referrals to juvenile detention and other practices that disproportionately push students of color, students with special needs and LGBTQ students from the school system and into the criminal justice system. Teachers Unite members organize across the city to build school partnerships, develop educator and student leaders, and grow Restorative Justice practices. Through participation in city-wide and national coalitions, TU members stand with students, parents, and advocates calling for an end to racist disciplinary practices. Last year we raised over $20,000 which went directly to support NYC student- and educator-led projects that made their schools safer for, and respectful of, all students: from the establishment of a peer mediation program in a Brooklyn school to a student-designed course on Transformative Justice in the Bronx. &nbsp; “With Teachers Unite&#8217;s support I created an elective about Restorative Justice. A student in the elective was constantly facing suspensions. He became a leader in our classroom, passed all his classes and helped facilitate community-building activities with peers and teachers. With a huge smile, report card in hand, he asked if he could take my elective again.” -Kate R., Special Education Teacher, Brooklyn Frontiers H.S. &nbsp; This year a Restorative Justice team of educators and students at Brooklyn Frontiers H.S. is planning to train 20 educators in their school in how to use restorative circles to conduct student meetings. &nbsp; Your Donation $30 buys a week worth of snacks for graduating peer mediators and their mentees during after-school trainings. $55 will provide MetroCards to 10 students from the Bronx to a citywide meet-up of young people leading Restorative Justice practices in schools. $200 supports a student from a Teachers Unite school team to attend a three-day advanced Transformative Justice training $1,000 supports students to publish a toolkit on Teachers Unite&#8217;s website that helps others to replicate their organizing project. &nbsp; Through our advocacy, organizing, training, coaching, and development of resources, our work has led to hundreds of students and educators being trained in and/or leading and developing Restorative and Transformative Justice practices and programs in over one hundred New York City non-charter public schools that serve over 90% students who are eligible for Free and Reduced Price Lunch. There is no way to capture the untold numbers of suspensions, school-removals, and arrests that have been prevented by the community building, awareness, and de-escalation skills learned in these school communities. As a leader, and the only educator organization, in the Dignity in Schools Campaign-New York (DSC-NY), we are proud that our coalition achieved the allocation of $2.4 million by the New York City Council for a Restorative Justice Initiative to support school-wide implementation of Restorative Justice (RJ) practices in 25 New York City schools in 2015. We serve as the chair of the Pilot School Working Group of DSC-NY and shaped the basis for this win through our support and documentation of successful RJ implementation in schools. Through the City Council initiative, 15 schools in low-income communities with high suspensions rates have been supported to hire full-time Restorative Justice Coordinators and receive training for all school staff in restorative practices. In addition, five schools with some experience in RJ received additional training to expand their practices, and five schools received funding to serve as mentors to the other schools in the initiative.",,,,,ended,,Teachers_Unite,

Each year, to safeguard the physical and psychological integrity of women victims of violence and their children, and to promote a new life without violences, the RNR performs around 60 air transportations, benefiting at least 40 women and their families.

With the Internet boom, gender violence has found a new scenarios in social networks; taking advantage of the fact that many young women, adolescents and girls use them in an insecure way. This is Celia´s story, a story that should be known by everyone. Celia (nickname we will use to protect her identity); She was a teenager from a neighbourhood in Managua, who, like any girl, spent a lot of time on social networks, making friends. It was in social networks where she met &#8220;nice&#8221; boy, who supposedly was the same age. After getting to know him, he agreed to meet him in person and they met in a park. But, it was a trap. There was no such person, it was a band of men; whom put her into a car and took her away. Hours later they left her abandoned, with serious physical consequences; her family took her to the hospital, where she died a couple of days later as a result of the collective rape she had suffered. Celia was like many of the girls and boys we know, a girl who approach social networks to entertain themselves, not to be attacked. Her story, a femicide in 2015, was never denounced, and not registered in the statistics. It exemplifies the sexist violence present in all areas, the violence that nowadays is through the digital. In EnRedadas, in the past four years we&#8217;ve been working on gender and technology, and we have identified that this problem needs an urgent response and young girls are the most exposed. For this reason, we want to contribute to preventing digital violence, by creating a Feminist Itinerant School for Women in Managua (EFÍMera) in order to prevent that Celia´s story repeated itself. With your help, the Feminist Itinerant School for Women -EFÍMera- will visit neighborhoods and municipalities of Managua to implement a popular education strategy and train 75 young women, between 12 and 17 years old, who are in situations of vulnerability and need to know technological tools to help them strengthen their digital security from a feminist perspective.

The project’s goal is to support the detainees so that they can be self-advocates throughout their case.

Please help us obtain this challenge so that we may help farmworkers defend their interests and advance important initiatives on immigration policy, wages and working conditions, occupational safety, health and access to justice. Why it matters: Founded in 1981 and based in Washington, D.C., our mission is to empower farmworkers to improve their wages and working conditions,health, immigration policy and access to justice. We carry out our mission through policy analysis, advocacy, training, legal assistance, coalition-building and support for worker organizing. The Shelley Davis Memorial Fund is named after our lateDeputy Director who was a remarkable attorney and advocate. Her advocacy, litigation and direct assistance to farmworker organizations on labor, immigration, occupational safety and health issues were recognized nationally. Shelley was especially committed to empowering women farmworkers to become leaders and preventing farmworkers and their children from being exposed to pesticides. There about 2.5 million farmworkers in the United States not including about 2 million family members. The large majority are immigrants from Mexico, and a majority are undocumented. Your support for the Shelley Davis Memorial Fund at Farmworker Justice will make a difference in the lives of hundreds of thousands of farmworkers and their family members. We will advocate for fair, comprehensive immigration reform that includes a path to immigration status and citizenship for undocumented farmworkers and their families. We will oppose harsh immigration policy proposals and help farmworker groups throughout the country respond to those proposals. We reveal the devastating impacts of pesticide poisoning and oppose reversals in occupational safety policies. Farmworker Justice will continue our longstanding watchdog and advocacy roles for effective enforcement by the US Department of Labor of farmworkers’ few rights. And we file lawsuits in federal court to protect farmworkers against abuses. Your contribution to this matching challenge will also support our assistance to community-based organizations that operate promotores de salud, or community health worker, programs. We help farmworkers understand how to prevent pesticide poisoning and other injuries, how to respond to sexual harassment, and how to mobilize community resources to address the health needs of farmworker families. Using the traditional and social media, we educate the public and policymakers about the valuable contributions farmworkers make to our society and economy and the solutions needed to address the challenges that unfairly confront them. Farmworkers have difficult lives but they have made gains over the years. We must not let the current Administration wipe out those gains. In addition to your tax-deductible contribution, we hope that you will follow us on social media at www.facebook.com/farmworkerjustice and www.twitter.com/farmwrkrjustice, and on our blog, www.harvestingjustice.org, and sign up for our newsletters at www.farmworkerjustice.org. Thank you. Potential Challenges: There has never been a more important time for the assistance that Farmworker Justice provides to farmworkers and their organizations throughout the country. We serve the people who labor on farms and ranches to produce our food. The Trump Administration has attacked immigrants even though this is a nation of immigrants and even though we would not have a food system without immigrants. Deportations have instilled fear in farmworkers and their children. Many are afraid to go to school, to medical appointments and to courthouses. The Trump Administration also has promised that it will slash regulations. That means that vitally important labor, occupational safety, environmental and health protections will be reduced unless there are successful campaigns to stop him. Your support will help us address the challenges, defend farmworkers and advance positive initiatives of farmworker organizations.",,,,,ended,,farmwrkrjustice,

We believe that maintaining a more continuous flow of new content, more flexible resources for illustrating the features, and expanding certain areas of interest, such as children’s books, young adult novels, and scholarly works will enable the magazine to appeal to a wider Latino audience and begin to serve as a venue for non-Latinos to gain greater appreciation for Latino writing. Somos will be a place for Latinos to learn the publishing industry and fundraising for non-profits via assisting Somos in its growth and continuation. As an e-magazine in the forefront of growing U.S. Latino literary pursuits, Somos en escrito would expand the scope of its content through Open Access Publishing, and thereby promote and enable scholars from various academic disciplines to inform a wider Latino audience as well as the general public as to their findings and insights in their respective fields. Open Access is a global system by which academic world libraries that promote works that are both peer reviewed and non-peer reviewed on the same platform just as we see in the powerful search engine Digital Commons. Somos en escrito is a form of open access. Achieving these goals will require the Foundation to assemble a professional staff with top notch support personnel using the latest computer systems and programs to transform the magazine into a publishing resource serving the Latino community in general and writers in particular nationwide. This will put us into more competitive mode with established Anglo literary outfits. For now those two jobs will be part-time and on-call. We estimate that the transfer of all the archives to a new platform will take about $2,000.00 and to have an on-call illustrator a cache of another $3,000.00 through 2018.",,,,,ended,,somosenescrito,

Statistics show that two out of three Mexican women have been experienced some kind of gender based violence. 96 % of survivors of intimate partner violence are women and 47 % of women living with partners have been subjected to domestic abuse. &nbsp; This November 25, International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, is a day to remember what happens the other 364 days of the year. Every day, an average of 6 women in Mexico are killed. Every day, women in Mexico City navigate a transportation system considered the second most dangerous in the world for people of their gender. Every day, stories surface about women such as Tamara de Anda, who was able to report the man who harassed her, or Lesvy Osorio and Mara Castilla, who tragically were not. 1 out of 3 women have tolerated violence. Addressing this violence requires targeting its source: the entrenched culture and gender norms that make violence against women acceptable. TOGETHER, WE TARGET THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM Our mission in Gendes is: 1) To challenge the dominant model of masculinity in Mexico rooted in machista norms 2) To replace the model with alternative versions of masculine identity that support gender equality. 3) To fundamentally alter the conditions that make violence against women socially permissible 4) To build a society that is equitable and safe for people of all genders. &nbsp; With your assistance, we will be able to: &#8211; Support re-education groups for men that help them to stop violent behaviors and start to develop relationships based on mutual respect, empathy, and equality. &nbsp; How do we solve this problem? By guiding the men in: &#8211; Recognizing the forms of violence they have used &#8211; Unlearning the tenets of machismo masculinity that lead to this violence &#8211; In creating egalitarian, healthy, nonviolent relationships. Your support will also make possible: &#8211; Our awareness campaign, which brings the critical issue of masculinity and its relationship to sexual violence everywhere from national legislative agendas to: 1) people’s Facebook feeds 2) radios and TV programs 3) mailboxes. &nbsp; CREATING CULTURAL CHANGE Your financial support is invaluable to us.

In a visit to El Caserio 3 de Mayo, a group of foreigners witnessed that the children spent the entire day roaming freely around the streets of the village without adult supervision while their parents were working. This situation raised their concern leading them to design a fold of services needed to address this and other areas of improvement. The first initiative developed was the establishment of a Day Care Center and a School for the children of the village. Today, the day care center has 18 children and the school 120 students. In parallel, an entrepreneurship project was launched – called “Craftswomen”. There are 13 women representing 13 families in the project already allowing the working mothers to stay close to their children instead of commuting long hours to work on a daily basis. And, the last initiative already opened is the Medical Center, built next to our Day Care Center. In this Medical Center we have paired with another NGO to fight against malnutrition. In the end, the sum of all these projects allow us to reach and impact almost the entire population of the village – close to 1000 habitants. The Project The project &#8220;Craftswomen&#8221; has grown and do not have a proper and suitable place to work. So they require the construction of a workshop. Why is it important? It is important to highlight that this group of artisans have been trained with family values, income management and entrepreneurship. The overall results obtained from all these efforts have been very encouraging. The project has become self-sustainable over time. All costs are covered from sales, ensuring profitability in the long run. However, the most important achievement has been the impact on these women´s self steem while embracing an independent and entrepreneurial version of themselves for their future. But above all, the most rewarding outcome has been able to spend more meaningful time with their children and appreciate the delicate nuances of their childhood. How will funds be used? We need to raise $5,000 which will be used to build a specialized workshop that will serve as a production space for our craftswomen. The structure will be 6 meters x 6 meters with 2.80 meters high. The walls will be built with modern bahareque with 5 French windows with 1.50 x 1.20 meters. The walls will be finely refined, designed with stained glass bottles.",,,,,ended,,,https://vimeo.com/210689189

However, at present, there are still conditions and situations that hinder the proper development of children and adolescents, as is the case of Afro-Peruvian children and adolescents. Discrimination and social exclusion are one of the great problems facing the Afro-Peruvian population in general, and children and adolescents in particular. Approximately 2.5% of children and adolescents in Peru are Afro-Peruvian, however, their situation of invisibility means that there are still no specific public policies for this population, although little by little efforts are being made to reverse this situation . The Ethnic Development Center (CEDET) is one of the non-profit civil organizations that seeks to reverse the situation of vulnerability and invisibility of the Afro-Peruvian population, and that promotes work with children and adolescents through the Palenques Infantiles, considered as spaces of freedom that seek that all Afro-Peruvian children can express their point of view and that their voice is heard in the different spaces of their community. We place greater emphasis on working with Afro-Peruvian girls and adolescents, strengthening and developing capacities that serve as empowerment mechanisms in order to reverse their situation of poverty, becoming agents of change that promote initiatives for and by children and adolescents, revaluing their Afro-Peruvian identity. &nbsp; Why is it important? Afro-Peruvian girls and adolescents do not usually complete regular basic education, much less higher education, mainly due to adolescent pregnancies at an early age that start between 12 and 15 years of age due to ignorance of contraceptive methods due to the difficulty in access to information, family violence, limited professional aspirations for social stereotypes, and especially the situation of poverty in which they live with their families. We seek to reverse this situation by strengthening and developing capacities for Afro-Peruvian girls and adolescents to become empowered and, above all, visible. &nbsp; How will the funds be used? In order to achieve our goals, through the Palenque Infantiles, work with the community, the family and Afro-Peruvian children and adolescents is required in Lima. To this end, we will conduct awareness-raising workshops with the neighborhoods of Villa María del Triunfo and San Martin de Porres in Lima, so that they can learn about the problems facing Afro-Peruvian children and adolescents. Also, training workshops with parents on prevention of family violence, protection of the rights of children and adolescents. With girls, identification workshops and capacity development: educational, productive, entrepreneurship. Health campaigns and awareness campaigns on issues of discrimination, protection of rights, Afro-Peruvian children and adolescents. Finally, it is of great importance to promote studies and research on Afro-Peruvian children, since one of the difficulties in generating public policies is the lack of statistical data regarding this population. &nbsp;",,1.

This year, we are re-launching the campaign to continue accompanying the dream of these indigenous youth in migratory contexts. &nbsp; Our Story &nbsp; The &#8220;Dreamers for Education&#8221; campaign is a fundraising project that began in December 2013, promoted by the organization Voces Mesoamericanas, Acción con Pueblos Migrantes and HIPGive (a crowdfunding or collective financing platform). It aims to create a high school, vocational training, and college scholarship fund for Tsotsil and Tseltal students from the highlands of Chiapas, Mexico. &nbsp; Who are the Dreamers for Education? &nbsp; They are young people, both women and men, between 15 and 25 years old, who are from Tsotsil and Tseltal communities in the highlands of Chiapas where they do not have the means to exercise their right to study, nor do they have access to other freedoms and human rights. They are immersed in migratory contexts: they have migrated, have returned from migration, or are relatives of migrants, in order to support the livelihoods of their families. They have the dream of studying to build a better present and future. &nbsp; All of them participate in the creation and development of economic, political, organizational, cultural, and artistic alternatives within the indigenous migrant communities of which they are a part. &nbsp; What are the Dreamers for Education looking for? &nbsp; The scholarship fund is an opportunity for indigenous young men and women to continue in education processes that contribute to the development of skills, thus contributing to the construction of what in Tsotsil and Tseltal Mayan languages is known as “Lekil Kuxlejal,” an indigenous concept of communal well-being. &nbsp; Scholarships consist of support for transportation, food, tuition, and learning materials. In the last three years, the “Dreamers for Education” campaign has facilitated in the connection of 26 young people to different educational projects. &nbsp; Each year we seek to give scholarships to more Tseltal and Tsotsil young people, in addition to continuing to support scholarships for those who are currently studying. &nbsp; Why is it important? &nbsp; Quality education is one of the many rights denied to indigenous communities. The possibilities for them to access formal education at the high school, vocational, and college level are limited or often nonexistent. Likewise, discrimination continues to be a reality experienced by the indigenous population, combined with educational models that do not recover nor recognize their culture, knowledge, needs, experience, and ways of seeing life. &nbsp; Young migrants who return to their communities of origin encounter structural and financial limitations to continue their studies and to access work opportunities and living wages. This project allows us to open up those opportunities for some of these young people. &nbsp; The young people who have benefited from these education scholarships are a worthy example of the struggle for the construction of “lekil kuxlejal,” the indigenous concept of communal well-being. This is why we will not stop being dreamers. &nbsp; Without the support of your contributions, access to the right to education for our friends would be more difficult, and in some cases impossible. We are so grateful for your heart and commitment to transform this reality, and for continuing to give us hope to continue believing in the path of solidarity.

Having a dental clinic at DAR has several benefits; our agreement so dental students will be able to do their supervised internship. 4. The dental clinic is a self-sustaining project, where dental treatments will be provided at a low cost to the community.","Information of the Organization The Manuel and Concha Ralda Foundation were found with the main objective of promoting education and continuous training. Education will provide people with the necessary tools to achieve the full satisfaction of their needs and the longed for human development. In 2010, the District of High Performance &#8211; DAR &#8211; La Trinidad, open its doors with its vision of reaching children in rural areas of Guatemala, who living in situations of risk, poverty and orphan hood. DAR, through providing a holistic attention and give an opportunity based in education, supports children in the rural area so that, with the right tools, they can become to transformational leaders for their communities. Using the five-pillar strategy, DAR provides a powerful long-term package that equips the child and their family with all that is needed, not only to leave the cycle of poverty behind and become a solid rock and future productive citizens who are versed in leadership and what is needed to achieve success. For the District of High Performance –DAR-, education goes beyond the normal curriculum, because through the method of multi-intelligences, the child develops his skills and works to strengthen those areas high in his intellect. As part of the holistic model that DAR handles, it not only seeks impact on the student, but also we educate the family, as to provide everyone with the opportunity to improve their quality of life, impacting the child&#8217;s environment and transforming the community. Proposed project The importance of oral health as an element of general health and well being for quality of life of the person; it is considered as an essential part of health. In Guatemala the stadistics show that national level, service provided is 978 dental clinics, which translates to one clinic for every 15,000 inhabitants (national health diagnosis, 2012). Based on this data, in Retalhuleu there should be 18 public dentalclinics, unfortunately this shows the failure by the Government in the coverage of this issue. Canton Ocosito, is an area of the population living in extreme poverty. The lack of resources often prevents them from meeting the basic living needs, dental health is a service that falls outside its scope and priority. A culture of oral hygiene at an early age is important for promoting comprehensive health level. This problem has led us to seek the implementation of a dental clinic to provide opportunities for this important health factor, promotion and prevention of oral health to ensure improved quality life for children and families in the community Ocosito. Besides being an inaccessible, nonexistent and expensive service, families in extreme poverty do not have a culture of prevention in oral health, therefore the long-term consequences are irreversible and lead to physical illnesses associated threatening health status overall. In the past two years, DAR has had three dentists visit, that through medical evaluations revealed critical conditions of oral health and loss of parts due to lack of vitamins and hygiene. However, lack of equipment, furniture, and the high cost of materials, have affected the failure to follow the professional diagnoses. Oral health conditions continue to deteriorate and the risk of disease is increasing. This clinic will give attention to the 226 children who are students of DAR, the 118 families of these children with low-cost treatments. It will also be open to the population of the Ocosito Community providing treatments at low cost and accesible.",,,,,ended,,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roX0MnWc9wI

The Scholarship Program Sponsoring Dreams began in 2016 as an initiative of a group of young people to observe the socioeconomic vulnerability of rural youth in the department of freedom in El Salvador, which prevented the continuation of their studies of secondary education or higher education.

In this campaign we DREAMED WITH RAISING $ 2,500.00 DOLORES. And if we manage to raise $ 1,500.00, we will be able to grant scholarships to 6 young people with greater socioeconomic risk, &nbsp;And if we raise the $ 2,500.00 dollars this will serve to grant scholarships to 10 young people and this would pay for their parents not to risk their basic basket, therefore, they expect better quality education and nutrition of their children. It is worth mentioning that young people contribute part of their time to volunteering to demonstrate their skills and abilities as future professionals and to contribute to the development of their communities. In 2017 we have managed to grant scholarships to 6 young people this year.

The club meets every Saturday morning in the garden patio of Museo Na Bolom, a historic cultural center, which sponsors the Club- supplying meeting and work space. After a short lesson, the girls go out on photography assignments around town and into the villages. They return in the afternoon to download their cameras, make their editorial selections and discuss the day over snacks. After each class, the teaching leaders help the girls ‘upload’ their photo selects and write captions to a weblog which they use to communicate with a class of The Lower Eastside Girls Club girls who in turn sends pictures to them. The girls who are members of Club Balam (a name they chose themselves- it is a combination and feminization of Na Bolom, “house of the jaguar”, and Girls Club…ie Club of little Jaguar girls) live in extreme poverty. Their families, representing a number of indigenous Tzeltal and Tzotzil Maya communities, have been pushed out of their villages due to religious and economic pressures. Lacking skills, education and in some cases even the ability to speak Spanish, these families struggle to survive in the barrios of San Cristobal. Without Club Balam, their daughter’s futures would be bleak. In addition to learning how to use digital cameras and computers, the girls are learning how to navigate new cultural terrain. As they meet new and caring adults they develop both personal self-esteem and a sense of the opportunities that are only now becoming open to women in Latin America. Through Club Balam they have women role models and mentors, are encouraged to stay in school and begin to think beyond the traditional roles of wife and mother. The cost of keeping Club Balam alive for these girls is modest and the rewards great. We have no doubt that as Club Balam grows they will be able to find sources of local and national support. In the meantime, The Lower Eastside Girls Club is committed to helping our sister organization as much as possible.

We have had a long and rewarding collaborative program with Club Balam, bringing young women artists (16-25) to Chiapas, and Mayan women to NYC for almost two decades.

Kilimanjaro to improve educational conditions in Guerrero.,"Project Overview One of the determinants of development is access to education, since it can achieve declining equity and reducing poverty. In Guerrero, the average year of schooling is 7.3 which is the third lowest nationwide. According to the Inter-American Development Bank, the quality of school infrastructure has a significant influence on learning and it has been shown that schools with the greatest need of students have poor results. That is why 6 ambassadors of Children in Joy will climb to the summit of Kilimanjaro, the highest mountain in Africa, with the aim of inspiring us to contribute to this cause. Our Goal Raise $420,000 MXN ($22,000 USD) to build a classroom in a primary school located in a marginalized area of Acapulco, Guerrero. This will provide safe, adequate and quality infrastructure to improve student´s academic performance and teacher´s work performance. In the medium terms, we will be able to increase enrollment and stay in school, contributing to the students being more motivated to continue their studies at secondary level.

Our first film screenings started in 2016 with gender being the central theme for that year. We travelled with it through 11 different departments (states) of Guatemala with one goal in mind; to put up for discussion themes like: violence, the trafficking of people, racism and discrimination, and the repression that our community leaders face. Excited about the results and achievements we met during our first year, in 2017 we headed of once again for another year of film screenings, and this time we named it “Origins”. We started with a goal of 6 different screenings with the idea of bringing together and getting to know the 4 different big nations that make up Guatemala (Maya, Xinca, Garifuna and Mestizo), and sharing their cinematographic work. Furthermore then getting to know each other, was another purpose; to create a space of dialogue and coexistence to talk about matters such as: racism, exclusion, marginality that we undergo as first nations along with other groups of our countries. Our audiences are diverse, we go to schools, Non-profits, NGO’s, cultural and art centers, libraries, and we also take over public spaces. The road gets hard at times, muddy, arid, or rocky, we travel by boat, bus, pickup trucks, tuc-tucs and more to get to our improvised movie theatres, which may end up being a classroom, an old or abandoned house, a neighborhood center, sometimes it is a church. The sound of plastic chairs being dragged or metal chairs bumping into each other surround us, people gather to see what is going on or what have they been called to come together for, whispers come and go, “What time will this start”?, “What will we see”?, we hear. The lights fade out…… Film, images, sounds, music, you see yourselves on screen! This are Guatemalan films!! They are similar to what we experience!! It is similar to our lives&#8230;Yes! Now we have somewhere to start the conversations, to think and take action. &nbsp; What are we going to do? Film is for everybody, we want to continue taking it to many more communities of our country, we want to keep creating and making this family bigger. We also strongly believe that art and especially film is a tool to helps us start conversations that are necessary and many times avoided, educate, and forever bring change and transformation. Also it is a format that is highly accepted by the audience. To keep this beautiful dream and project alive we need basic equipment such as a projector, laptop, speakers and a mobile screen which we are lacking at the time. We need your help not only to get our basic equipment but also to help us support and fund next year’s 2018 national screening. We are working voluntarily and ad honorem. We self-fund our projects and have also received much help form our different community partners through our alliances. We will keep building bridges. However to keep going further and generating a bigger impact. We need your help! &nbsp; How much can you help/donate with? You can help us out with donations of $5, $20, $50, $100 and more. This money will help us buy the equipment we are in need of to continue with the screenings and to pay for our basic expenses. &nbsp; Who are we? A collective of cinematographer and artist women. We believe in art and film as a powerful social transformation tool and wish to give back to our people from our creative and professional spaces. What else can you help us with?

In 2011, I decided I really needed to have a change in my life-style and went back to running which brought me to run a first half-marathon and then a marathon. Since then, I have completed a total of 10 marathons, one in the spring and one in the autumn. The impact of this in my life has been great: I’ve lost more than 25 Kg and changed my health condition completely and my perspective about many things. On October 8th, I will be running my 11th consecutive marathon at the Chicago 2017 Marathon, it will be a special one as I will complete the 6 major marathons of the world. Something I would have never thought to be possible! I want to make it a more meaningful run and I believe the best way to achieve it is through fundraising. Some of you know that my nephew Liam was born prematurely on week 31 and he spent 5 weeks in Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. Today he is an incredible 7 year old boy and we as a family are thankful for that every day. My niece Mei was also born prematurely on week 24 and unfortunately, she passed away after 24 hours of being with us. We will always have her in our hearts and she is an important part of our family. Because of this I chose Prematurity as the cause I want to run for. In Mexico, there is not much information on prematurity and there is only one organization truly devoted to this cause: it was founded by my friend Jessica after the passing of her baby twins Andres and Vicente Andres who were born on week 26. Together with a friend, she created Con Amor Venceras, A.C., an NGO in Mexico focused on prematurity, which works alongside Mujer Mexico. &nbsp; Fundraising Goal I wish to raise 3,500 USD to help them in the initial growth of the organization and we really want to use this fundraising to create more awareness regarding prematurity in Mexico and internationally. Every donation you can make, no matter the amount, can truly make a difference and will be greatly appreciated. If you are donating in honor of a particular preemie baby, please add in your donation message the name of the baby, I will make sure to run with all the names. Please also share either the social media post or the link that will appear after your donation, so more people will know and we will get the support and impact we are looking to achieve. Prematurity in Mexico &#8211; More than 150,000 premature babies are born every year according to official statistics. &#8211; The average daily cost of medical expenses for a premature baby are $2,000 USD per day, not to mention the cost borne by the parents as some or both must stop working to remain in the NICU for the care of their baby. &#8211; In 2014 more than 25,000 children died in Mexico before reaching one year of age, the great majority of these losses were the result of a premature birth. These deaths can be considered as the result of inequality, since not all babies have access to &#8220;good birth&#8221; or quality medical services for their neonatal care. They are not even guaranteed the right to fight for their lives, as they do not have provisions that require their attention regardless of gestational age or weight and this decision is made at the discretion of health centers. Many of these deaths and subsequent disabilities are preventable with proper attention. &nbsp; About Con Amor Vencerás Con Amor Vencerás was founded as a nonprofit in 2011 and aims to represent, empower and raise the voice of premature babies and their families in Latin America. The name means “With Love you will Succeed, first things first”, and reflects our belief that the role of parents in preterm birth prevention is the first thing to achieve a healthy birth. Globally, but more in developing countries there are all too many opportunities to improve maternal health, diminish neonatal deaths, and enhance the quality of life of preemie babies, their families and society.

CAR Youth were forced to emigrate due to ongoing violence in their country of origin. They embarked on a dangerous journey through the desserts of Mexico, and ended up incarcerated in U.S. detention centers. Once reunified with their parents or guardians, their hopes and dreams of starting a new life free from violence continues to be challenged through a complex transitioning and reintegration process. If CAR Youth have family in the United States, they are unified with their family or relatives they have not seen for over a decade (which is about half of their lives for many of them). They must integrate into new schools with new cultural practices, without knowing the language. This results in a deep feeling of alienation. The reality is that many of the Los Angeles neighborhoods they come to live in are communities with high incidents of violence and low-income populations, and thereby lack proper health resources and social service systems. CAR YOUTH are coping with anxiety, depression, and PTSD. Of the over 250,000 youth who came in since 2014 about 40,000 have not shown up to their court hearings because of the fear they have that their motives for leaving their countries will be questioned unconvincing to the judge resulting in their deportation. These youths are currently the primary target of the U.S. Administration for deportation. Organizations in Los Angeles like CARECEN, Bresee Foundation and Saint St. John’s Well Child Center among others step forward and do great work in providing help with their trauma; while some assist them with navigating their immigration legal process. Homies Unidos is helping CAR Youth with the culture shock they are experiencing in their schools and with their families. Homies Unidos continues to reach out to schools and community service providers to refer youth who need mental health or legal services to these and other organizations. As part of a preventive strategy we began implementing the Joven Noble, character development program to provide a safe space where they can express themselves through empowerment of their cultural traditions and teaching tools to enable the transition into their new lives. Through this Conference we will address the need to bring youth from other schools that are not benefiting from these services, where they can share experiences and be introduced to health service providers and other resources. Finally, we need to ensure these youths have a successful, healthy, safe, and well-supported integration to our communities. Therefore, in solidarity with Central American refugees, Homies Unidos is proposing to put together the third Central American Youth Leadership Conference. The main purpose will be to ensure that these refugee youths feel welcomed and protected from deportation, introduce them to service providers and to celebrate and promote Central American art and culture, while making this conference locally accessible. &nbsp; Goals Our conference main goals look to: &#8211; Strengthen our support for youth, especially for Central Americans and their families who have survived through resilience, the violence and economic difficulties from their country of origin and the culture shock in their communities. Creating spaces that will support them in their journey to healing the trauma from the violence and overcome with resilience in an anti-immigrant environment. &#8211; Create the basis for solving the problems that our youth are faced with in a way that centers their main problems and basic demands in order to survive by obtaining decent jobs, continue their education and access holistic health services that will help ease their integration into our communities. Central American youth participate and graduate from our summer Youth Leadership Training that prepares them to organize this conference themselves. Learning together to protect themselves under this current anti-immigrant environment as well as continue to organize outside of the conference around health disparities predicated by the social determinants surrounding health. Central American youth from various schools in Los Angeles will benefit from the health resources and cultural activities provided by organizations which in the long run can result in more support from the main community stakeholders, endorsers, funders, and the youth themselves; which in turn creates opportunities for health referrals, positive reinforcement, and self-esteem building for CAR youth. &nbsp; Why it matters? Currently, support for immigrant children and youth is not being prioritized and in fact is waning. In that context, the extremely difficult reality that Central American Immigrant Youth face once they integrate goes beyond their PTSD, the effects of displacement, and language barriers has been the focus of the Trump administration. Crimes committed by youth on the east coast have brought negative attention to the issue of refugee youth and their lives are at stake. The families, shelter or school staff, are not able to reach or support this population without effectively building culturally relevant approaches and interventions. Traumatized immigrant youth are at risk, their families or guardians do not know how to deal with their experience and basic figures reflect most schools are ill prepared for this student population. Their needs are very different from that of American students. By bringing youth to a conference, we will provide resource providers the opportunity to do outreach in one place to over 500 youth. Youth will feel the experience of a university setting, they will participate in workshops addressing many of their needs, in a non-judgmental environment where they will feel the support of the community. The increasing number of deportations is incrementing the number of family separations and launches low-income-to extremely low-income families into dire economic hardship. The impact of loss and economic pressure is experienced in behavioral changes in older children who have had parents deported or incarcerated which often include: increase in aggression, PTSD symptoms (particularly if they witnessed their parents being arrested from inside the home); increased criminal activity; inter-community violence; juvenile incarceration (and getting caught in the vicious cycle of recidivism); and self-destructive behaviors such as substance abuse, teen pregnancy, domestic violence, self-injury, self-mutilation, and suicide. Historically, the consequence of not creating a plan to support and welcome refugees has created plenty to draw from to reconsider as the best opportunity to overcome the lack of planning, involved traditional and new stakeholders from the communities. The Central American Youth Leadership Conference has been created for our youth, to welcome them into our communities, where they can feel safe, protected and encouraged. This is the third conference we will have. Our youth will be in the forefront and we encourage you to join us. &nbsp; Evaluation We will leverage our resources through fundraising activities. Build on the momentum already established in Los Angeles, focusing on organizing youth and involvement in community coalitions through a multi-lateral campaign that engages the immigrant community. We will have evaluation questionnaires of the conference. Focus groups and follow up communication forms after the conference will be utilized to implement and measure success of the goals. With feedback from the youth and community who attended the Leadership Training, forums and advocacy efforts, we can better determine the needs of the youth and families we support and how to meet them. In addition, we will report on the resolutions provided by our youth during the conference. &nbsp; How will the funds be used? The Central American Youth Leadership conference funds will be used to provide the immediate expenses for food, beverages, buses, and printing materials. These funds will help support the overall budget of $23,000. We will be conducting a fundraiser event in September 2017. We will also be providing sponsorship opportunities. There will be perks available to the different amounts of donations made through HipGive. We are also providing volunteer opportunities for outreach as we get closer to the event and at the day of the event. You can also help by spreading the word to youth who may benefit from the event.

A school where families learn how to break the poverty cycle By creating opportunities for development and productivity. By providing free integral and high-quality education. By building a social support system for the entire family. This is the only way in which the kids may experience all of which you are accustomed to: food, pencils, books, notebook, a mother who knows how to help you, or a father that actually supports the family. Objective: Providing an alternative educational approach through the use of technology to complement and aid the quality of the learning process for the kids in Futuro Vivo in Guatemala. Problem: Digital gap is an expression that refers to the difference that exists between[JLM2] communities with access to technology (new information and communication technologies), in comparison to those that don’t. This expression also refers to the difference among groups according to their capacity in terms of efficient use of Information Technologies, due to the varying levels of alphabetization and technological ability. The aforementioned gap is also related to the competences that people posses or not to access it. One of the main problems that developing countries face, and particularly Guatemala, is the difficulty to access education: “technological illiteracy” which refers to the unfamiliarity with basic tools to access information and communication technologies, as well as the ability to transform the information obtained into usable knowledge. Technological illiteracy significantly reduces the possibility to access work opportunities, due to the fact that digital competences have become and will continue to be, a mandatory requirement. Solution: Technology can help in the reduction of poverty, being that it decreases social, geographic and economic barriers, at both the individual level and among communities. With the implementation of tablets in the classroom, we will promote creativity, provide a tool that allows children to learn at their own pace and develop technological dexterity, as well as support the teacher in the teaching-learning process. With a tablet in their hands, the children will actually have a vast media library, with photos, texts, electronic maps…a whole universe to explore: it is taking the chance of letting the kids have fun while they learn. We are positive that our children will become citizens capable of interacting, learning, negotiating and deciding through digital media. What are we going to do? 30 tablets with keyboard, available for kids from 1st to 6th grade. Audiovisual equipment for 2 preschool classrooms Internet access With technology in the classroom we will: Encourage and promote the children’s autonomy and leadership. Favor peer cooperation between those who share the device. Through this cooperation, the possibility of support among children is established requiring those with better skills to share their knowledge with others. Allow varying degrees of demands to be established: This permits each child to access a different learning level and move forward at their own learning pace. These resources are integrated to our teacher training programs, syllabus (curricula), texts, and media resources favoring the educational experience, and as part of the opportunities that generate equity (and equality) among the students in our country.",,"Educación Personalizada Costo Cantidad Total Q Total $ % Tablet con Teclado Q1,602.00 28 Q44,856.00 $6,053.44 73.97% Aula Multimedia Proyector Q3,193.00 2 Q6,386.00 $861.81 10.53% Audio Q1,950.00 2 Q3,900.00 $526.32 6.43% Pantalla Q950.00 2 Q1,900.00 $256.41 3.13% Ampliación de cobertura internet Routers/Repetidores de Internet Q450.00 8 Q3,600.00 $485.83 5.94% Total Q Q60,642.00 $8,183.81 Medio Cantidad Monto Estimado Total Alcancía 10 Q1,000.00 Q10,000.00 $1,349.53 Padres de Familia Q2,100.00 $283.40 Venta en Universidad Q2,000.00 $269.91 Q14,100.00 $1,902.83 GAP $6,280.97",,,ended,,,

These clubs provide a safe, secure after-school environment with homework assistance, tutoring, mentoring, and the opportunity to experience support and guidance that will help students achieve academically. Some of our children struggle in school and have little or no support at home because of language or other barriers, but these clubs provide the assistance they and their parents need to succeed &#8212; students like Sixth-grader Bernardo Gaytan. Gaytan says he likes Cabrillo&#8217;s Homework Club at Valle Naranjal Apartments in Piru because he receives individual help with his schoolwork from the tutors, and he&#8217;s receiving good grades. For his mother, Maria Gaytan, the assistance is invaluable because she does not speak English and cannot help her sons herself. &#8220;One of my sons is in special education classes and requires extra assistance with reading out loud. The homework teacher has the patience and technique to help them better their reading and writing skills,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Of the two years they have attended homework club, my son is able to focus on homework and be less distracted than at the beginning. Because I do not speak or understand much English, I will sit next to him as a reminder to focus, but the teacher will help him pronounce the words to make sure he’s saying them correctly, ” Homework Clubs are an integral part of the community at four Cabrillo properties. They play a vital role in the success of our resident youth Instill a love of reading Provide opportunities to develop stronger English language skills Reduce truancy and improve students&#8217; success in school We hope to expand these services to two additional properties and provide them year-round instead of just through the school year. A donation of $25 provides up to two hours of tutoring assistance at one of our homework clubs. Will you help these kids succeed? How the clubs were developed: The Homework Clubs have been developed in response to Cabrillo residents&#8217; interests and needs that were identified by staff through surveys, focus groups, one-on-one interviews, and resident/community meetings. According to the parents, the children are having trouble with schoolwork and find it hard to concentrate at home and have no one to provide homework assistance. The parents are unable to help because both are working, are monolingual, and have a low level of education. In addition, due to their financial situation, the families often do not have enough money for school supplies or afterschool snacks. Cabrillo’s resident population are households earning less than 80% of the Area Median Income for Ventura County. Our 3,900 residents are 95% Latino; 39% under the age of 18; and 39% Extremely Low Income, 39% Very Low Income and 17% Low Income. The homework clubs target the 500 school-age youth in six communities, four of which are primarily farmworker properties, and the other two are subsidized by housing vouchers. Three properties are located in the low-income census tracts of Oxnard, two in agricultural-adjacent areas of Ventura, and one in a farmworker community in Santa Paula. The homes are primarily Spanish speaking, with the children bilingual. &nbsp;",,"Cabrillo Economic Development Corporation Resident and Community Services 2017 Budget &#8211; Cabrillo Homework Clubs Line Item Resident &amp; Community Services Director (10% total compensation) $10,300 Resident &amp; Community Services Coordinator (10% total compensation $5,570 Resident &amp; Community Services Coordinator (10% total compensation) $5,570 10 Tutors (50% total compensation) $12,480 Books $2,400 School Supplies $2,400 Snacks $12,480 Travel $1,400 Utilities (10% Indirect) $5,260 TOTAL $57,860",,,ended,,CabrilloEDC,

What we do Mundo Posible&#8217;s mission is to contribute to improve the quality of education and reduction of poverty by facilitating technology tools to schools and rural communities, involving local skills and talent. Our main tool to accomplish it is RACHEL (Remote Area Community Hot Spots for Education and Learning), a digital library with some of the best educational resources from the web, including Wikipedia, Khan Academy and many more, available in an off-line format through low cost servers that distribute a free wireless connection. RACHEL can instantly turn a graveyard of unused/underused computers into a learning center, and any teacher, student or parent can also access the content through their smartphones, since it can support up to 50 devices simultaneously, without any internet or telephone fee, ever. Along with every RACHEL installation, we provide a training program for teachers to learn how to access the content and to use different methodologies, including &#8220;self-organized learning environments&#8221; (SOLE, conceptualized by Sugata Mitra), with their students in every subject. Our Goal Our goal for 2018 is to reach at least another 50 rural schools to deploy RACHEL and train their teachers, with support from donors and partners that include the Ministry of Education, with whom we just signed a cooperation agreement, and other local institutions and organizations. This will contribute to our longer term vision, which is that every rural school in Guatemala has access to high quality digital resources. We have already secured the funds to cover 12 schools in the western highlands of Guatemala, as well as the funds to carry out an impact study throughout the school year to measure students’ improvement in language and mathematics, and changes in teacher practices. Why it matters In Guatemala, public schools have historically shown low averages in mathematics and language grades, and we believe that RACHEL, along with a teacher training program, can contribute in a significant way to improve these results. Education, as we know, is key in the developing process of any country, not only accessible but of high quality. From 2014 to 2017, we have installed RACHEL in more than 160 schools and have trained more than 1,200 teachers countrywide. According to some teachers’ testimonials, modules such as the Khan Academy math videos and the different resources for research/reading have helped students improve their performances. However, as mentioned before, an impact study will be carried out next year in coordination with one of the most respected universities in terms of research and technology in Central America, to confirm the real impact of RACHEL in the classrooms. We need your help In order to deploy RACHEL and train teachers in 38 schools, to complete or minimum target for 2018, we need $30,000. Funds will be used to cover the costs of the RACHEL servers, the traveling expenses for deploying it in public schools, the training of teachers and follow up visits to monitor and evaluate its usage, resolve any technical issues and strengthening teachers’ skills. The average cost for each benefited school is around $800 depending on the equipment they have, but any amount would help us reach more and keep supporting thousands of students and teachers in rural Guatemala.

En el Estado de Guanajuato, México.",,,Health/Youth Development,Mexico,Preventing teenage pregnancy and advancing gender equality among young indigenous women in central Mexico.,"1. The problem to be addressed. Guanajuato ranks third in teenage pregnancies. According to INEGI in 2015, the percentage of women between 13 and 19 who have been mothers or are pregnant, amounts to 29.5%. The problem of adolescent pregnancy is worrying, especially considering that the situation is accentuated in the Indigenous Communities that are in the regions with the lowest socioeconomic levels of the State. The Statistics of the Health Secretariat of Guanajuato indicate that the problem far from surpassing has increased even more since they mention that from 2012 to 2015 the unit attended 63,400 pregnant adolescents (8% more than in previous years) of these more than 1580 were under the age of 15. In this context, the Municipalities of Tierra Blanca, Victoria, Xichú and San Luis de la Paz occupy respectively the third, fourth, fifth and eighth places at the State level and data from local health centers indicate that the adolescents of the Indigenous Communities present A higher rate of unwanted pregnancies and STI transmission. In recent years, in these 4 municipalities there is an increase in the percentage of pregnant adolescents: 11% in 2013, 17% in 2014 and 19% in 2015, (SSG 2016) (State DIF 2016). Teen pregnancy charges great importance, according to the number of events presented. 2. Why is it important to address this problem? A pregnancy compromises the possibility of adolescents to materialize the desired life project. Aspects related to desertions or discrimination in educational and social contexts; Early linkage to the labor market; Greater probabilities of entering productive chains of underemployment or other unstable forms of employment relationship; Family and emotional tensions that triggers intrafamily, gender and obstetric violence, tend to compromise the ability of adolescents to insert themselves into a path of personal development. They consider that the high rates of pregnancies in adolescents, are increased by the existence of gender inequality. In other words, due to discrimination against women and girls in health, education, income and full exercise of sexual and reproductive rights; Insofar as the social prevalence of the phenomenon can be seen as an expression of the low empowerment of Indigenous women in decision-making. It is therefore of utmost importance to give continuity to the process of work and methodological training that the local networks of young women have been carrying out and what good results it is giving. With the present project we seek to provide awareness and training tools for the reduction of teenage pregnancies. 3. How do we intend to address the problem? We intend to continue the work in order to reduce pregnancies in adolescents, STI infections and the negative consequences for young women brought by such an event. For the present project we will work with the technical tool called participative workshop, where a collective construction of the knowledge and a customized application of the solutions is realized. We intend to influence through a combination of sequential actions at the individual, family and community levels. We will support the process through participatory workshop cycles, psychological care, guided visits to the itinerant and interactive exhibition &#8220;What Wave with AIDS&#8221;, and opening spaces for dialogue, exchange, analysis and reflection on the problems involved in the practice of a sexuality without Information that can lead to STIs or an unwanted pregnancy. 4. What will the donations cover? You can help them build a better future! A donation of only $ 10 provides psychological support to a teenage woman. $ 30 provide follow-up training to a youth-integrated support network. $ 100 allows a Youth to complete the course on Empowerment, Leadership and Sexual and Reproductive Health. $ 200 train 3 women to prevent adolescent pregnancy and promote gender equality. 5. What impact will you have if this project becomes a reality? 350 adolescents through 60 workshops will consolidate knowledge about gender equity, intrafamily violence and sexual and reproductive rights, allowing them to identify and explain their needs, expectations and general experiences for decision making in search of decreasing rates of teenage pregnancies, contagion Of ITS based on a new culture free from any type of violence directed at Women and Girls. In addition, they will put into practice the tools obtained during the previous stage of the project, improving family and community relations, consolidating the bases for the creation of a citizenship that respects the rights of women and children.",,,,,ended,,,

(NYC DOE 2010; CDC 2011; Gillibrand 2014). The L.O.V.E. Mentoring Program was founded in response to the many studies that reveal stark and staggering discrepancies between young Latinas and other racial or ethnic groups. L.O.V.E. supports and empowers young Latinas to strive both in school and in life through positive role modeling. About the Program The L.O.V.E. Mentoring Program will develop a daylong conference called: “ Be-YOU-tiful’– L.O.V.E.&#8221;. The conference will consist of a series of workshops and activities that will cover topics related to the importance of self-LOVE and self-esteem. The themes that will be addressed include natural hair, body shapes, social media influence, physical health and wellness, nutrition, makeup and hair sessions and poetry about self-LOVE. The goal of the Be-YOU-tiful’ conference is to promote and educate our L.O.V.E. participants on the importance of loving ourselves just the way we are which will in turn ensure a balanced and healthy emotional, physical and psychological wellbeing. The Be-YOU-tiful’- L.O.V.E. conference will take place in a reserved space in WeWork Bryant Park. Be-YOU-tiful will be a daylong conference where experts and organizations will cover their respective topics and will be in charge of implementing workshops and activities with our L.O.V.E. participants. Donations and sponsoring support will help us to provide an empowering experience that will contribute to continue enhancing and uplifting the levels of self-esteem and self-confidence among young Latinas. Our goal is for our L.O.V.E. mentees to walk away from the Be-YOU-tiful conference feeling empowered, uplifted and rejoiced. The “Be-YOU-tiful’– L.O.V.E. conference” was created after L.O.V.E.’s first successful “L.O.V.E. Yourself” conference in November of this year. The L.O.V.E. Yourself conference consisted of a daylong series of workshops that covered topics such as mental health, healthy relationships and reproductive health. The workshops for this project were provided in partnership with some of our current partners, including the Mount Sinai Adolescent Health Center; Girls Health Ed; DOVE and EndAbuse4Good. This conference aims to empower L.O.V.E. participants by raising their levels of self-LOVE and self-esteem. We will measure the impact of the conference by providing surveys to our L.O.V.E. mentees regarding the areas that were covered during the sessions. The Be-YOU-tiful’– L.O.V.E. conference is very relevant to the Latino community based on the negative and inequitable outcomes experienced by Latina youth, especially as they relate to cycles of poverty (Bondy, 2015; Cammarota, 2004; Garcia, 2009; Mendoza-Denton, 2014; Sánchez, 2009; Sy, 2006). Latina girls in the United States are subject to some of the highest rates of detrimental outcomes such as leaving high school without a degree, pregnancy, and attempted suicide within their peer group (Garcia, 2009; Mendoza-Denton, 2014). L.O.V.E. has been successful with high school retention rates in a population that is most at risk for high school attrition. All of our L.O.V.E. mentees in each of our programs have either graduated from high school or have been promoted on to the next grade level. This year, our mentees from TYWLS of East Harlem graduated from high school. These students were part of L.O.V.E. during their four years of high school. They were all accepted to college. How we&#8217;ll use the funds The Be-YOU-tiful&#8217; &#8211; L.O.V.E. conference budget will entail $5,000. Funds will cover the cost for space, food, materials and transportation. If there are any additional funds they will be used to support our mentoring programs. All donations will help to increase the levels of self-esteem among young women in NYC.

La Barra de Santiago, one of the most beautiful beaches located in the municipality of Jujutla, department of Ahuachapán, has an extensive mangrove where its inhabitants are dedicated, above all, to fishing, despite the extreme poverty conditions that some people live in; Crop production and livestock grazing. For the last 12 years, the Bar Association of Santiago (ABS) has developed different projects in coordination with the inhabitants, which benefit more than 1,000 people. Coconut and Morro Handcrafts The association centers on the improvement of job opportunities through the production and sale of morro and coconut handicrafts, for which they have established a workshop equipped with tools for the elaboration of the products in an artisan way. At the moment there are 50 people dedicated full time to the production of a variety of handmade art, among them napkin holders, glasses, table decor, ornaments, among other decorative objects. Some of the production is sold at retail stores in the capital &#8211; San Salvador. The project was initiated this year by Irma Charur, entrepreneur and member of the association and Juan Harrison, President of the Association. Why is it important? The dream of the association is to multiply the impact through hand-crafted supplies and benefit more single &#8211; unemployed women in the community that need to take care of their children and are unable to work. Value chain innovation will inspire new designs and therefore grow the business by increasing sales and profitability. By supporting this community, more families will be benefitted and more women will develop their entrepreneurial and creative skills; building a better future for the new generation. How will funds be used? All the funding raised through this campaign will be used to purchase a band engine to expedite the production and improve the quality of its finishes.

Our Organization helps those who need it most, for years we have supported poor communities, vulnerable groups and people on the street, with the earthquake emergency we reaffirm our commitment to continue doing it to benefit many more people During the earthquake thousands of people left their homes to save their lives, nobody believed that when they returned they would see their house destroyed and even worse that their belongings were among the rubble, the objective of this campaign is to raise funds to buy shoes for those families that they lost everything, many children and adults only have the pair of shoes that they wore during the emergency and now they are worn and broken, with their help we can deliver a pair of shoes to each member of those families. Each dollar received will be used for the purchase of shoes, we made a contract with a shoe sales company that will give us the price of the manufacturer so that we can buy more products at the best prices.

Every year we give them hundreds of stores, shoes and clothes, in December we give toys to children and in November we make a great dinner for dozens of people in street situation We face many risks when handling the resources of donors, it is also difficult to deliver such a quantity of shoes, however, digital media helps us with online monetary transactions and thus avoid theft, when the shoes are delivered, a large amount of volunteers accompany us and in this way we avoid that the products are lost.

Latinos/as comprise 40% of the population in California, yet nearly one third of California’s population age 25 and older (30%) had a Bachelor’s degree or higher, but only one in 10 Latinos in that age group (10%) had a least a Bachelor’s degree.

Though they were paid above the minimum wage, for years they received the brunt of their manager&#8217;s disfavor: they were constantly made to do the hardest tasks, lift the heaviest loads, and work while their white coworkers took rest breaks. They were even forbidden from speaking Spanish to each other in the back of the shop at all times, effectively silencing them at work. When the workers finally demanded fair treatment, the owner promptly fired them and reminded them they were powerless to fight back because of their immigration status. Community Legal Services in East Palo Alto is bringing a case to win justice for these workers. On International Workers&#8217; Day, Community Legal Services in East Palo Alto pledges to keep fighting against abuse and discrimination in the workplace to ensure that ALL workers receive equal treatment and dignity on the job. Join us! Latinx immigrants are an important part of our workforce! Each year, undocumented immigrants contribute as much as $1.5 billion to the Medicare system and $7 billion to the Social Security system, even though they will never be able to collect benefits upon retirement. Their work strengthens our economy despite the difficulties they face in the workplace and the fear they experience if their employers choose to use their immigration status against them. At Community Legal Services in East Palo Alto we strive to educate workers about their rights and to protect them in the event that their livelihoods are threatened. Over the last two years since our Worker&#8217;s Rights program started, we have helped over 100 people exercise their rights in the workplace. Without donor support these victories would not be possible. Your donation helps contribute to the economic stability of our immigrant community!

From the outset we have sought to empower our community through providing access to media and a platform to showcase creative forms of expression from visual and literary arts to performance and music. We do this via our three major programs: 1) El Tecolote newspaper – Since 1970, we have produced the Southwest’s longest-running English/Spanish bilingual newspaper, with a bi-weekly circulation of 10,000 copies. El Tecolote is created by volunteers from our community, covers the issues that matter to Latinos in the San Francisco Bay Area and is made always available for free. 2) The Juan R. Fuentes Gallery – We opened our art gallery at the end of 2015 specifically to showcase the work of established and emerging artists, whose work depicts the nuances of Latino life locally, nationally and internationally. The majority of the proceeds from art sold go to the artists, and all gallery events are free to public. 3) Cultural Arts – Each year we produce a rich assortment of cultural events, which include everything from backyard poetry readings to free community concerts featuring local musicians, to the annual Encuentro del Canto Popular Festival (now in its 36th season), which has celebrated the Latin American tradition of cultural resistance through music since 1982. &nbsp; Why it Matters Over the course of nearly five decades, our space has become a cultural hub, a beacon for Latino culture and creativity throughout the San Francisco Bay Area which is located in the symbolic heart of the city’s Latino community. As the tide of gentrification continues to sweep across the Mission District, displacing Latino families from their homes, it is more important than ever that we stand our ground and do all that we can to help preserve the Latino cultural imprint in San Francisco. &nbsp; Potential Challenges Latino culture and Latinos across the United States find themselves caught in a kind of cultural backlash at the moment. The current political climate has also seen a steady increase of hostility toward the media, the arts, and the nonprofit world (particularly organizations with a social/community justice orientation). It seems that at the moment practically everything our organization stands for is under fire. &nbsp; How we’ll put your donations to work: We are a largely volunteer-based organization, but we need to provide our volunteers with the tools to complete their work on all of our various projects—media equipment, cameras, press-passes, reporter’s notebooks, photo/video editing software, access to printers, wifi and capacity building &amp; training.

The goal is to reduce the number of women in Latin America who die each year due to cervical cancer. The first phase of the project will begin in Peru where the need is greatest and then copied in Mexico and other countries. What we plan to do is: Conduct molecular tests to detect HPV with good inter and intra-observer correlation, reliable quality assurance, very high sensitivity, relatively simple application, and at a moderate price; Work with over 4,000 women and conduct HPV testing on a self-collected vaginal sample; Mobilize a small group of local women who previously received training on cervical cancer awareness to teach other women about cervical cancer and how to do the self-collection; while encouraging compliance with treatment and follow-up; Use cell phone text messages to link women to treatment and follow-up services. Why it matters: Cervical cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer death among women in Latin America. In 2015, an estimated 74,488 women were diagnosed with cervical cancer in Latin America, and 31,303 died of the disease in Latin America. Without better health, women cannot care for themselves, their families and participate in economic opportunities. In Peru, 1 woman dies every 5 hours from cervical cancer. Although Pap smears are available at public clinics, the quality of the test and access to services are very poor. In addition, fear and lack of knowledge and information prevent women from participating in screenings that would lead to early detection and treatment. This project will empower women to take charge of their health and therefor improve their lives now and in the future! Impact of Your Donations: With your support, the project will: Mobilize a group of local women (HOPE Ladies) who in 2015-2016 received cervical cancer awareness training and training in the self-collection of cervical samples to be community leaders and teach over 4000 other women about cervical cancer and HPV testing. Purchase screening kits to allow over 4000 women to conduct self-administered HPV testing at home and receive follow-up screening and treatment. Develop a national information system that would include online access to results, referrals, a hotline, and a link for Q &amp; A about cervical cancer. Develop and execute national health promotion activities offered by &#8220;HOPE Ladies&#8221;, including instruction in self-breast examination, breaking myths and promoting HPV vaccinations of girls with mothers, and other activities. Make clinic visits accessible for women to get further screening and appropriate treatment. Develop a mobile program using cell phones to send SMS messages to connect women to treatment and follow-up care. About our organization: Uniting for Health Innovation (UfHI) formerly PAHO Foundation and Cayetano Heredia University in Lima, Peru join forces in reducing the number of women in Peru who die from cervical cancer. UfHI is a U.S. 501 (c) 3 non-profit organization that unites government, industry, and local communities to advance innovation in public health. Over the past few years, UfHI has partnered with the Ministry of Health of Peru to undertake a significant initiative to bolster women&#8217;s cancer programs and registries in Peru. We are now building on this work together with Cayetano University, a multidisciplinary academic institution in Lima, Peru, and Dr. Patricia Garcia, former Minister of Health of Peru and elected member of the American National Academy of Medicine. The goal of this partnership is to advance a new model of screening and testing for cervical cancer to improve the health and lives of Peruvian women – giving them HOPE for a better future.",,"Budget: HPV tests around 25 dollars per test………………..$100,000 (includes kit, all supplies &amp; processing) Equipment for the HPV testing ………………………..$30,000 Training of women and incentives……………………$15,000 Development of the information system………….$30,000",,,ended,,UfHInnovation,

Keep reading and discover how &#8230; &nbsp; When I arrived in Mexico City I never thought that I would have to return with a black dress in my suitcase and my soul, if it exists, destroyed for my mother&#8217;s funeral. I came with the hope of attracting the case of my mother&#8217;s kidnapping to the PGR. I came to knock on the doors of old acquaintances and friends to seek guidance in the investigation. My mother had been missing for 15 days and the UECS never investigated her possible kidnapping, even after having had the suspect in their hands, the intellectual author, the person who committed the crime, which they released, on two occasions! &nbsp; My mother, deceived, was deprived of her freedom in a shopping center in Chihuahua city, on Wednesday, April 5 at 4:30 p.m. Two hours later, a man that my mother had cared for and protected as her own son, picked up his truck in the company of 4 other people and just like that, disappeared. &nbsp; On Friday, April 7, there was a ransom call and then a call to collect the ransom. The crime was already a kidnapping; however the UEAS, the prosecutor&#8217;s office and the state government denied it until the last moment. That same day, at 17:00 hours, the UEAS decided to let the killer go, claiming that they would follow him on his phone, small problem, they never gave him his phone or they followed him. &#8221;He’s gone&#8221;, acknowledged the director of UEAS in front of my family. &nbsp; They believed the victimizer and victimized my mother and my family a thousand times. They suggested that my mother would appear somewhere, &#8220;taking a coconut on the beach&#8221;, they investigated our accounts, our medical profiles, our passports and visas, our telephone behavior; and yet, NEVER, NEVER investigated the suspect, EVER. They discarded videos, tests, calls, did not investigate telephone records; basically they were determined into proving their preconceived theory. And when they did not find anything, they opted for the rumor, the leaks, the transcended, as if my family were not people, we were not victims, as if we did not suffer the loss, they delved into our lives and finding nothing, their last option: the &#8220;lady had to be a whore&#8221;, because of course, that sold and exonerated. Why do all the women who disappear have to be whores or did they look for it? As I saw it, I read it and learned it when dealing with victims of missing persons. How I experienced it today. It is always easier to discredit the victimized woman. &nbsp; The outcome: the murderers on the loose, teacher Matilde Gil Herrera, appeared with a bullet in her body, with signs of having fought for her life. Buried in a hole in a vacant lot, her truck burned and our family: destroyed, trying to rebuild us, to find ourselves dressed in black. &nbsp; There are more stories like these, of women who have been victims of violence, some survive, and others may not even know what happened to them. &nbsp; We do not want this to continue happening. We seek to use technology and connectivity as a means of education and protection for women, to alert and prevent gender-based violence through an active community. &nbsp; In the application that with your donation we can develop, we want to create: a user registry, emergency network (family and friends), panic button, geolocation with real-time map, google maps where the user can indicate safe or unsafe places, connection to 911 for help, connection with the Attorney General&#8217;s Office to inform online, send alert messages for family members enrolled in the application, community forums (with topics, about: safety tips, infographics, videos, predetermined question naires, how can I know if &#8230; I have been abused ?, legal assistance information). &nbsp; With your donation, help us create a safe and violence-free environment for Mexican women and girls!

The causes are various. Over the past several years, climate change has produced severe weather phenomena resulting in both, flooding and prolonged drought. There are more immediate causes as well, including deforestation, the destruction of soils through inappropriate agricultural practices, pollution of freshwater resources and the over exploitation of key aquifers. The root of the problem has to do with the management of water and the lack of good governance in the water sector due to inadequate policies, programs, practices and effective institutional structures. This situation has led to chaos, scarcity and hunger for small producers, especially women working in the agricultural sector. During the last several years, record breaking temperatures have been registered and flooding or prolonged droughts have destroyed agricultural crops. Planning for future crops has become riskier and traditional livelihoods are being threatened. In the meantime, Salvadorans are becoming increasingly aware of the importance of good water management for the future viability of their country and for the generations to come. Water is now seen as a strategic resource, essential for life and for sustainable development. In that regard, it is considered a basic human right and a life or death issue. According to the United Nations, El Salvador has the most devastated natural environment in the western hemisphere, after Haiti, with 93% of its surface waters polluted by toxic chemicals, heavy metals and waste matter. And the Latin American Water Tribunal reported recently that El Salvador is on the verge of a severe water crisis, in terms of quantity, quality and availability. With a population density of almost 300 inhabitants per square kilometer (the highest in the western hemisphere), the environmental situation of El Salvador is likely to worsen in the years to come if efforts to attain legislation for more effective integral management of water resources is not forthcoming. Project Goals: The SHARE FOUNDATION´s campaign, “Water is Life: Defending the Right to Water and Sanitation in El Salvador”, is an effort to educate, build awareness and empower community participation in the ongoing struggle in El Salvador to resolve a water crisis that threatens the future of the nation and its people. The specific policy goals of the campaign include: Approval by the Legislative Assembly of a constitutional reform recognizing water as a basic human right, and Approval by the Legislative Assembly of a General Water Law establishing adequate policies, programs, practices and institutional structures capable of assuring good governance with equitable, efficient and sustainable water and sanitation management Accompany organized communities, especially with woman, in the struggle for water Share has decided to launch a campaign and support the struggle that many communities in El Salvador are suffering involving the lack of water. We wish to create a fund that will support 210 families from El Bajo Lempa in the department of Usulutan. This fund will buy grains and food to help them in a short term plan with their current crisis, but will also give an initiative to expand the campaign and support an ongoing demand to establish a general water law in El Salvador. &nbsp;",,"Share has decided to launch a campaign and support the struggle that many communities in El Salvador are suffering involving the lack of water.

We provide complete case management including counseling, court advocacy, pro bono lawyers, translation services, referrals to social service agencies and accompaniment when necessary, as well as continual follow-up until the survivor is leading a truly fulfilling life. The rapidly growing number of Hispanic domestic and sexual violence (DSV) survivors in Western North Carolina suffers from very limited access to legal and social service assistance. This project works to knock down the financial, linguistic, psychological and cultural barriers that prevent these abused men and women from gaining the justice, recompense and healing they so desperately need. &nbsp; STOP THE GROWTH OF VIOLENCE On the average domestic violence survivors wait until the 7th incident to report the problem. This project will procure justice and healing for many of these victims and will give hope to other victims so that more will come forward and request the assistance we can offer. By offering effective assistance we hope to cut this number significantly and thereby cut the overall number of DSV incidents. &nbsp; OFFER SURVIVORS CULTURALLY SENSITIVE SUPPORT The majority of our domestic violence survivors and their family members come from cultures where DSV was always kept secret and there was no trust in authorities. Therefore, these survivors do not feel comfortable bringing these problems to light or seeking justice The culturally sensitive bilingual services Transforming Lives offers have already made a difference. Since our inception in 2017 we have been able to help 150 survivors and their families. Our services are crucial as testified to by the Henderson County District Attorney’s Office who has called our “ excellent work in advocacy and legal and social services for Hispanic domestic violence victims, unparalleled” in our area. And these services are truly needed. &nbsp; DONATE-REACH ALL SURVIVORS Your donation will contribute to the expenses associated with the process of accompanying our clients through the legal and psychological process that they must follow to get rid of their abusers and overcome the psychological issues that prevent them from achieving a healthy, productive, and independent life.

These children grow up without the care of a family, and often suffer from illnesses related to the little care they have received, among them oral affections. These homes do not always have the necessary resources to provide dental care to children, and this is why there is a high prevalence of tooth decay, mouth infections and premature tooth loss. &nbsp; What can we do? With your support, we will be able to provide dental care to more and more children who have been victims of neglect. Our dentists and volunteers not only carry out dental procedures but also teach them good oral hygiene habits, in addition to equipping them with mouth cleaning implements such as toothpastes, toothbrushes and floss. Our intervention is of great importance and it is urgent because many of these patients have gone through long periods of dental pain. In the eyes of these children we also find sadness and fear, but if we manage to approach them in a friendly and affectionate way, we can turn their treatment into a positive experience that will influence their well-being and their confidence in society. &nbsp; How will we put your donations in action? To carry out our project, we need multiple medical-dental supplies such as: Toothbrushes Toothpaste Dental floss Gloves Masks Anesthesia Dental materials Portable equipment Disposable instruments &#8230; and the means of transport to mobilize all this to the homes. &nbsp; In case of not reaching the proposed goal, our program includes in its most basic version the delivery of oral hygiene implements and oral cleaning education activities. But in case of exceeding the goal, we can replicate our project in more homes. &nbsp; Why does it matter? Oral health plays a very important role not only for the feeding functions, but also plays a role in the self-esteem, nutrition and well-being of these children in general. Our work is vital to relieve pain, to control infections and especially to prevent later problems. The impact of our intervention will not be measured only in the treatments performed on these children, but also in the problems that will be avoided in the future. &nbsp; About Fundación Salud Oral We are an organization based on the participation of volunteer dentists and seniors dental students, our people not only love what they do but also believe in the mission of helping disadvantaged groups of the population through the improvement of the oral health. Not only your donation is important: follow us on Facebook as @FundacionSaludOral and on Twitter as @Fundas0 and share our publications. Your support to disseminate our project will help us so that more people can join as well and that together we can achieve the goal. &nbsp; Thank you!",,$937 Oral cleaning implements / Implementos de limpieza bucal $538 Disposable supplies / Insumos descartables $346 Transport / Transporte $1079 Dental materials / Materiales dentales,,,ended,,Fundas0,

It provided safe and healthy afternoons where they could discover and develop their capabilities through fun and formative activities, the interest in learning and the academic responsibility, the healthy nutrition culture and the promotion of life skills. Why it matters: In reality, the state of Chihuahua has limited spaces for children in vulnerable situations to develop their skills. ADN provides them with such spaces and more. It is a safe space that seeks to prevent the integration of delinquency groups and street gangs.&nbsp;The task is not a simple one, it requires everyone’s cooperation to grant a space for children and youth to be part of the program. ADN has a scheme of formation, more than education, because it takes in consideration the profile of the participants, their families or caretakers, their environment where they live and thrive. This seeks to generate safer environments through long term social changes. It is implemented in basic level schools located in high poverty and social disintegration zones of the state of Chihuahua, providing focalized attention to students through activities that boost their capabilities, increase their responsibility and plant the roots of hope for a better future.&nbsp; &nbsp; Our impact is meassured in:&nbsp; &nbsp; Effect Impact &#8211;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;% of beneficiaries with satisfactory writing/reading skills. &#8211;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;%of beneficiaries with satisfactory math skills. &#8211;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rate of beneficiaries with positive school performance. &#8211;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;School stay rate. &#8211;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proportion of beneficiaries with a positive self-concept. &#8211;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proportion of beneficiaries with creative thoughts. &#8211;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proportion of beneficiaries with critical thinking. &#8211;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prevalence of beneficiaries with a positive vision of the future. &#8211;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Increase in life skills. &#8211;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Decrease in risk behaviour. &#8211;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rate of beneficiaries that develop a healthy and free of violence lifestyle. &nbsp; Come, join the effort!

Prospera’s Latina entrepreneurs have many stories to tell! &#8220;The Power of a Dream&#8221; is an audiovisual project &#8212; led by Gabriela Arvizu, Prospera collaborator, entrepreneur, freelance and audiovisual artist &#8212; that was born with a dream of documenting and amplifying the voice of entrepreneurial Latinas. Through a series of documentary videos, Gabriela Arvizu and Prospera come together to show the world real stories of entrepreneurial Latina immigrants building cooperative businesses in the Bay Area. The Power of a Dream: Stories of migration, cooperation &amp; leadership Despite the economic and social adversities that the Latina community faces in the today’s political climate in the United States, these entrepreneurs are creating new economic opportunities for themselves and their community through the cooperative business model and social impact entrepreneurship. Now more than ever, it is important to capture these stories as a way to recognize the leadership and daily struggle of these entrepreneurs, and to inspire many other Latinas. Our objective Our aim is to capture the stories of entrepreneurial Latinas participating in Prospera&#8217;s cooperative business incubation program, through four documentary videos. We will share their personal and professional adversities as well as their successes during their exciting journey to entrepreneurship. With this work, we want to make visible and recognize the work and struggle of all of these immigrant women and the leaders who are transforming their lives and creating impact in their community. For Gabriela, the partnership with Prospera is an opportunity to honor the strength and power of women who come to this country to fight for themselves, their families and their dreams. For Prospera, this partnership with Gabriela Arvizu will allow us to showcase Prospera’s work through the eyes of entrepreneurial Latinas. This is also an opportunity to promote Gabriela as an audiovisual artist and Latina entrepreneur herself. Why is this important? The lives of Latinas in the United States are fraught with challenges due to immigration status as well as gender inequality. These are structural, social, economic, and cultural barriers… there is still so much to do! We believe that when we recognize and invest in women’s leadership capacity, resilience, and cooperation, it is possible to disrupt many of these barriers. Through this project, “The Power of a Dream” the artist, Gabriela Arvizu, the entrepreneurs and protagonists of these audiovisual pieces, and Prospera will unveil the reality that this community faces daily on their entrepreneurial journey. Key barriers faced by Latina entrepreneurs: · In the United States, 1 million households headed by Latinas live on the threshold of poverty. · 28% of Latinas work in low-wage occupations. · 32% of Latinas do not have medical insurance. · Only 19% of Latinas have college degrees. · Approximately, 912,472 entrepreneurs are undocumented in the United States. Key Opportunities: • 11.6 million companies are owned by Latinas in the U.S., generating 1.7 billion in revenue. • Immigrant cooperatives are growing rapidly and exponentially in the U.S. • Women’s cooperatives around the world show powerful results: increased income, improved health, and increased well-being for families and communities. Help us make this project a reality Please help us reach our goal of $6,500. The East Bay Fund for Artists will match every gift we receive from individual donations up to $6,000. In order to get this match we need your contact information (Name and email address). These videos will amplify the voices of four Latina immigrant women, document their journeys to become entrepreneurs, and create opportunities for other women in the Bay Area. Your contribution will also make it possible for Gabriela Arvizu to present her entrepreneurial project at film festivals and to other audiences. Collaborate and get involved with Prospera!

My biggest challenge is to give the children the proper aide they need by tutoring them with their homework so they may perform better at school. My biggest concern is to provide the proper conditions for growth and development by obtaining the tools needed to include and provide an up-to-date technological resource in our classrooms.

In 1969, Acuña was the founding chair of Chicano Studies at San Fernando Valley State (today California State University Northridge). He has received the Distinguished Scholar Award from the National Association for Chicano Studies, and numerous academic and community service awards. Among his best-known books are Latino Voices (Greenwood Press, 2008); Sometimes There is No Other Side: Essays on Truth and Objectivity (Notre Dame, 1998); and The Making Of Chicana/o Studies: In the Trenches of Academe (Rutgers 2011). $50 The Hawk&#8217;s Reemergence, Alejandro&#8217;s Story, or Camino Doloroso by Roberto de Haro In The Hawk&#8217;s Reemergence, World War I pilot Oliver Purdom has so much waiting for him back home in the United Kingdom, but before he can return to his loving wife, his plane is shot down. However, that isn’t the end of his story. Decades later, Mexican American airman Vince Hollman enlists with the Royal Air Force. Vince has had a strange childhood. Ever since he was young, he has heard a ghostly voice in his head. He even visited a curandera, a traditional Mexican healer, about the phenomenon. He eventually made peace with this voice, but then a strange event makes him realize there is still much he doesn’t know about his own origins. Alejandro&#8217;s Story is about a Mexican American immigrant working in Hollywood during the 1930s. He fights during WWII in Europe, and returns to Hollywood after the war. Camino Doloroso is the story of a Mexican woman brought up during that country&#8217;s revolutionary period. She loses two husbands to the revolution and flees to the United States with four children and her childhood companion. She goes from privilege to poverty but manages to make a way for her family in America. Based on a true story, the challenges an immigrant single mother faces and must overcome are explored, from a personal perspective. The novel is filled with passion, hardships, and the challenges and disappointments a family must endure. Roberto de Haro, penname of Roberto Haro, a longtime activist in education and social concerns affecting Latinidad, is an essayist and author of several novels dealing with war dramas, crime mysteries, historical fiction and romance. He lives and writes in Marin County, a part of the San Francisco Bay Area. &nbsp; Thank you, once more, and please join us at http://www.somosenescrito.com/ &nbsp;",,"Branding (logo, web design, illustrator) $2,500.00 Contest prizes (upcoming poetry, short story, speculative fiction) $300.00 Web fees, transition to new platform $200.00 Publishing under own imprint (costs of on-demand printer) $2,000.00 Total $5,000.00",,,ended,,Somosenescrito,

Our vision is to end Latinx health inequities in California through policy and advocacy by connecting Communities to the capitol and doing the work that works. In order to achieve our mission, we must invest in our young leaders in the community that face health inequities and equip them with policy, communications, community building, and professional skills to foster sustainable youth power in the community and in the Capitol. That is why in partnership with Brown Issues, a statewide youth leadership-based organization devoted to the advancement of underserved Brown communities, the Brown Issues-LCHC Health Justice Fellowship was created. Our fellows work on Health Justice and Prevention initiatives and develop community-centered presentations to support The California Endowment educational campaigns such as: #Health4All, #SodaKills, #SchoolsNotPrisons and #Vota. They aspire to build statewide people power within latino communities, to better inform policymakers about the social determinants of health that influence Latino health outcomes. This work entails working closely with community groups, businesses and elected officials to develop grassroots support for initiatives. Our goal is to raise $10,000 to support the expansion of our Brown Issues-LCHC Health Justice Fellowship Program. And a generous donor has pledged to match dollar-for-dollar up to $10,000 in donations! Make a donation today and help us foster sustainable youth power! Why it matters: 34% of the CA Latino population is younger than 20, projecting a large proportion of older Latinos by 2060, we are investing in the next generation of Latino leaders. And, by donating today so can you. What you can do: There are many ways you can stay involved.

At 17, Institute of Critical Studies, we are supporting him by fundrasing in both Spanish and English. We are calling for small donations or larger donations in exchange for art works by many of Pedro&#8217;s artist friends. Pedro Miranda is the most important blind photographer in Mexico. Please give him your support to allow him to continue with his important work. Letter from Pedro To my friends, accomplices, confidants, and the general public: I’m writing these few lines in order to gather, with your help, the funds necessary for my ear surgery. This surgery is necessary because last May my doctor confirmed the loss of my hearing on my right-hand side. I have been suffering from an ear ailment called &#8220;otosclerosis&#8221; for several years. The disease has caused the ossicles in my right ear to calcify. Thus my hearing has decreased. My blindness is well known. Of course, the aditional deafness makes my day-to-day life all the more difficult. This is why I have decided to undergo the operatation. If the surgery does not take place, my auditory nerve will end un permanently damaged. In recent years, I have used a hearing aid that has help me. But soon it may no longer be of any use. I thus hope for the surgery to take place in December, 2018, in my home town of Oaxaca. The intervention is called a &#8220;stapedectomy&#8221;, and consists in the removal of my abutment and its replacement with a prosthesis that will perform its functions. I will thus be able to recover the my hearing and will thus be able to lead a normal life. I decided to have the surgery in Oaxaca because that will allow me to be in the hands of the doctor who has treated me for years and, therefore, knows my medical history, ailments and most suitable form of medication. I want infinitely to thank all the friends and acquaintances who have so generously donated their art works as part of the fundraising effort. I hope we can obtain the necessary amount. I thank you very much for your participation, and for sharing the present call. &nbsp; All donations will include a $3.00 USD charge to support Hispanics in Philanthropy, as it is a NGO itself When you make the donation, you have the option to chose your own amount and give a tip to HIPGive, which can be edited as well on the &#8216;EDIT&#8217; button",,,,,ended,,,

In a seven-year study, researchers found that minority students participating in work-based programs entered college at twice the rate of non-participating minority students and that college enrollment rates were higher for all students in the program when compared to local and state student populations. Another study found that 95% of youth who experience work-based learning in high school are more likely to enter college. We started TIP health pathway to address the need for more diversity in the healthcare workforce. The majority of students and youth we serve are risk factors: homelessness, poor health outcomes, foster care, teen pregnancy, families are torn apart by homicide and incarceration, and come to school hungry &#8211; all factors that put them at risk for poor health outcomes as adults. LA Promise Fund advances healthcare work-based experiences for students that have no little capacity to find these jobs, mentorships, internship experiences, and professional networks on their own. Our program operates in the largest public school district in the state and the second largest in the country &#8211; where graduation rates among Latinos are only 71%, and where just 34% of students graduated have fulfilled the necessary requirements to enroll at a UC or CSU campus. Our interns will address what it means to serve people of color as well as being a person of color in the healthcare field. TIP connects students to successful adults by giving them the opportunity to make professional relationships through experiences in the workplace and/or through mentoring programs. Through TIP, students&#8217; lives are forever changed over the course of an internship or mentorship. Campaign Goal: Bu achieving&nbsp;ur modest fundraising goal, we hope to grow our Healthcare Pathway cohort, while preserving the scope and quality of the program. Why It Matters: Growing the&nbsp;TIP Health Pathway will allow more high schools students to explore careers in the healthcare field. Our Health Pathway interns, students who often struggle to obtain the care and information they need, have the first-hand knowledge of being a person of color trying to access the system. Their perspective allows them to incorporate new information and consider careers in a field that desperately needs diversity now and in the future. Our Track Record: The LA Promise Fund coordinates programs and wraparound services in the areas of academic support, college/career readiness, socio-emotional development, health and wellness, and arts education for the benefit of more than 15,000 Los Angeles County students. Evidence for the overall effectiveness of our approach includes: for the eighth year in a row, the graduation rates for our West Adams and Manual Arts students have outpaced LAUSD. Manual Arts (91%) and West Adams (95%) surpassed the district&#8217;s 82% graduation rate. The graduation rates for African American and Latino students have outpaced the LAUSD as well. Manual Arts (80%) and West Adams (68%) surpassed the district&#8217;s 67% graduation rate among African Americans. Further, Manual Arts (78%) and West Adams (75%) also outperformed the district&#8217;s 71% graduation rate among Hispanics. When accounting for two-year colleges, more than 87% of our students were accepted to college or university. The number of West Adams&#8217; seniors accepted to a four-year college nearly quadrupled from 9% to 39% and have more than doubled at Manual Arts from 18% to 42% over the span of seven years. Furthermore, due to LA Promise Fund&#8217;s efforts, the FAFSA/Cal Grant completion rate at Manual Arts increased from 90% in 2016 to 94% in 2017 and the West Adams&#8217; FAFSA/Cal Grant completion rate increased from 90% to 93% laster year. Our success rates this year mark the highest percentage of students&#8217; filling for FAFSA/Cal Grants at our schools since we began Go For College in 2007. Potential Challenges: The majority of the funds we raise go to compensate the interns in our Health Pathways so that they may accomplish both intern experience and paid summer work and gain the professional development that the program offers. If you cannot give, you can still help out, by helping us connect to local businesses, healthcare and otherwise, that could host interns. Any help you can give us and our kids is greatly appreciated.

Yet, one in five Latinas does not complete high school by the age of 29 and just 15% of Latina women have a college degree. Poverty, language and cultural barriers play a part in this process. Latina children who speak little or no English may experience difficulties while adjusting to their school and may also have trouble learning how to effectively communicate with teachers, figuring out extra-curricular activities, and understanding daily cultural traits. This process can be overwhelming and interfere with their academic success. &nbsp; Imagine how the landscape of our towns and cities will change if such a large segment of the population is undereducated? The fact is that educational empowerment profoundly impacts economic development. The current reality does not match the future that Latina’s envision for themselves. In Listening to Latinas: Barriers to High School Graduation, a study by the Mexican-American Legal Defense and Education Fund, 98% of Latina students surveyed shared that they want to graduate from high school and 80% of students surveyed would like to graduate from college. The desire is there, the work ethic is there, yet the support and resources are not there. With your help, we can change this reality. At Circle de Luz we help girls graduate from high school and go on to post-secondary education. The girls participate in an intensive mentoring experience from tenth through twelfth grade, in addition to their class programming, called Adelante: College and Career Pathways. Through our Adelante program each girl is paired with adult mentors who work with them through the college identification, application, and acceptance process. They learn how to write effective essays, how to apply for FAFSA, how to seek out appropriate scholarships and, most importantly, how to choose a school that will allow them the best opportunity for success. Today 100% of our seniors have graduated from high school, which is 30% higher than the national average for Latinas. Fourteen young Latina women comprise our alumnae group and twelve of these individuals are currently enrolled in a post-secondary education program; this is an 85% success rate in relation to our post-secondary education enrollment goal. Our students have enrolled at UNCC, Queens University, Guilford College, Emory University, CPCC, and Paul Mitchell Cosmetology School and one is serving in the U.S. Military. YOU can be part of this movement! By donating today you will be directly impacting the lives of young Latina girls in Charlotte, NC. With the support of this campaign, Circle de Luz will create educational opportunities for underserved Latinas in the Charlotte Mecklenburg School District. Circle de Luz is committed to eliminating the education gap currently plaguing our Latina population, and giving them a fair chance to be educated and empowered women. How else can you help? If you are not able to donate today, there are many ways you can support our girls and their families. Are you an expert in a specific field?

First, SisterWeb provides doulas to resilient pregnant women from at-risk communities in order to ensure they receive the support they need to have healthy and satisfying pregnancies, births, and postpartum experiences. Doulas who participate in SisterWeb are professionally-trained, multilingual, and are committed to serving marginalized and historically underserved communities. Second, SisterWeb builds a diverse community doula network by identifying individuals from diverse communities who could serve as doulas, ensuring those doulas receive fair compensation for their work, and facilitating a doula mentor program. &nbsp; Our fundraising goal is $100,000 and we believe this is achievable based on the unrelenting support from members of our community! These funds will pay for program development, doula stipends for our two pilot programs with Latino and African American mother/doula pairs, and the cost of evaluating our first year of operation. We know that collecting data and measuring the impact of our work is crucial to the long term health of this initiative and we have academics ready to partner with us in developing these tools. &nbsp; SisterWeb believes that people of all cultural identification, family structure, income, or citizenship deserve to have healthy and satisfying birth experiences. In addition, SisterWeb recognizes that the uniquely intimate and private nature of birth requires a diverse and culturally competent doula network so that women of all walks of life can feel safe, secure, and comfortable throughout the birth process. Through its unique, sustainable model, SisterWeb attracts more people from diverse communities to enter into the doula profession and ensures that families can find a doula they can trust to help them achieve the best pregnancy and birth experiences possible. The close relationship between peers is at the heart of the efficacy of doula care. The pregnant mother often says about her doula: “She’s &nbsp;the one I call.” SisterWeb’s community doula model is different from other community doula programs because it ensures that participating doulas are paid for their services rather than requiring doulas to volunteer their time and expertise. The end result is that more individuals from diverse backgrounds are able to enter into and remain in the doula profession, ultimately ensuring that more families can find a doula they feel comfortable working with to achieve their ideal pregnancy and birth experiences. &nbsp; SisterWeb is uniquely poised to provide a solution to a well documented inequity in birth outcomes for women of color in San Francisco. Our members and founders are deeply rooted in the community and have partnerships lined up with well known community based organizations and medical institutions. Fist Five San Francisco, The San Francisco Foundation and others have already committed funding to help with our start up costs. They trust we will get the job done and you can add power to their partnerships in the form of your donations. &nbsp; For donors who give $500 or more, we are excited to invite you to a special donor event with our advisory board and doulas. For donors who give $1000-5000, we would be honored to list you on our website and include a short video about why you believe in our project.

Reproductive Justice is a framework that encompasses the rights of all people to 1) HAVE children when they are ready, and have access to the necessary support for healthy pregnancy, birth and parenting experiences; 2) NOT HAVE children and have access to the sexual and reproductive health services including contraception, comprehensive sexuality education and abortion; 3) parent the children we have in environments that are free of violence, both interpersonal and institutional. WHO ARE WE? California Latinas for Reproductive Justice (CLRJ) is a statewide organization committed to honoring the experiences of Latinas/x to uphold our dignity, our bodies, sexuality, and families. We build Latinas’/x power and cultivate leadership through community education, policy advocacy, and community-informed research. WHAT ARE WE DOING? Over the next 6 weeks, CLRJ is raising $2,000 to take 15 Latina/x leaders to advocate for the rights of young parents at the State Capitol. On August 15, 2018, members of our Young Parent Leadership Council from our Justice 4 Young Families (J4YF) initiative will travel to the state capitol to share their experiences as young parents with state and federal decision-makers to continue shifting the way our communities approach youth sexuality and their right to parent their children within a supportive environment. Our Latinas/xs leaders will talk to their representatives directly about California Young Parents Day and the importance of supporting young pregnant and parenting youth through the Young Parents’ Right to Education Act (AB 2289), a bill that would provide young parents up to 8 weeks of parental and sick leave in schools across California. It’s time ALL young people receive the support they need to thrive! HOW CAN YOU HELP? When young parents thrive, so do their children and our entire communities! Your donation to our campaign will help fund the travel costs of CLRJ’s delegation of committed community leaders to make the journey from Los Angeles to Sacramento. We need your support to ensure our Latina/x leaders are able to raise their voices and speak directly to our representatives about the importance of centering the needs of our communities. Your donation will not only support our travel and costs of training 15 leaders to advocate for their rights, it represents a way for you to contribute to the cultivation of Latina/x leadership across the state that supports and uplifts the 7.5 million Latinas/x and their families who are impacted by the policy advocacy and leadership development work that CLRJ has taken on in the state of California.

During her first visit to SLHP, she shared her story about the domestic violence she experienced in Guatemala. However, it was the murder of her 17-year-old son in November 2017 that brought her to SLHP in a state of distress. She was experiencing an emotional crisis and described feeling an intense pain and sadness. She was having trouble sleeping, had no appetite and a lack of energy. She also experienced daily headaches and crying spells. She felt loneliness, isolation and anxiety. At SLHP, &#8220;Flor&#8221; has received three sessions of individual counseling where she learned grounding and mindfulness as a way of coping. She learned breathing techniques to calm herself and be in touch with her body and mind. She returns to SLHP every week for further counseling. What is Street Level Health Project? Street Level Health Project (SLHP) is rooted in Oakland, California&#8217;s Fruitvale neighborhood. We are a grassroots organization that engages our community, many of them working as Day Laborers, in collective power and leadership to advance a just and inclusive society. We also provide a community health center with free and accessible medical services to everyone, including mental health, nutrition, herbalism, and help with navigating the healthcare system. Our health center is a unique model practicing intersectionality between traditional and culturally-responsive health care practices. Campaign Summary: We use a &#8220;Whole Person Care Model,&#8221; providing a comprehensive care for our community, a community often overlooked due to their undocumented and recent immigrant status. We also have community members with a high level of trauma collectively. Due to a fear of deportation and becoming targets of anti-immigrant sentiments, many refrain from accessing services available in efforts to protect themselves and their families. This adds to the multiple barriers they face when accessing health care services, which makes our outreach efforts essential in providing information and services to our community. We provide one-on-one consulting and education addressing our clients&#8217; personal needs. Our integrative approach provides community members with same-day access and comprehensive care across multiple languages to address both acute and chronic illnesses. Our medical services act as a bridge to primary care, but are not an adequate substitute for comprehensive primary care. Our resources and treatments are highly limited. But we do the best we can to meet our community&#8217;s medical needs within the constraints of our resources. SLHP&#8217;s services are FREE thanks to the support of individual gifts from our supporters. We do not receive federal or state funding (we are not an FQHC). We are the &#8220;safety net of the safety net&#8221; because we provide health access to a community who is 93% foreign-born with 43% often having resided in the U.S. for less than three years. These families are marginalized and excluded from the Affordable Care Act. Part treatment, part prevention, SLHP acknowledges the role of employment in maintaining health and mitigating illness among low-wage workers living at the intersections of poverty, malnutrition, chronic illness and homelessness. We see a high volume of community members with common ailments associated with nutrition, such as diabetes, hypertension and obesity. We utilize a comprehensive outreach service to target Day Laborers at multiple hiring stops around Oakland that include critical employment and occupational health education. SLHP also provides fresh fruits and vegetables and healthy meals for Day Laborers and their families. Our Impact: SLHP is an entry point to FREE health care &amp; social services regardless of immigration status or health insurance status. In 2017, we provided free health access to nearly 1,200 community members. Not only do we help provide on-site health services, but nearly 80% of our clients that visit our health clinic report having no other source of mental health care.",,,,,ended,,SLHealthProject,Street Level Health Project Introduction from Michelle Grace Steinberg on Vimeo.

Also, a registered nonprofit in Mexico, our organization is dedicated to the fight against human trafficking through prevention, intervention, and restoration programs. Founded in 2010 with our safehouse for underage trafficking victims, over the past eight years we have expanded into nine different anti-trafficking projects throughout Mexico. We work with the children, youth, families, women and communities who are most vulnerable to this crime so that they can experience freedom and restoration to rebuild their lives. We partner with local nonprofit organizations, government, and foundations such as A21, Operation Blessing International, World Vision, Orphaned Starfish Foundation, and Manpower for vocational training, academic tutoring, scholarship programs, and prevention events with children and youth. &nbsp; What problem do we fight? Human trafficking is an international phenomenon that affects millions of people each year. In México alone, the National Commission for Human Rights estimates that over 500,000 women and children have been victimized by this crime. In an article released in Forbes Magazine, 57% of the population in México is at risk of being trafficking for situations of vulnerability. In accordance with the 2017 Trafficking in Persons report, Mexico City is one of the major destination cities for human trafficking victims from Central America and also within Mexico. Mexico City has the largest red-light district in Latin America, with an estimated 50,000 girls working on an average day (per study done by Mexico City Youth Commission lead by Angeles Correa). Our solutions In response to the need for more specialized home for trafficking survivors under the age of 18 years old, El Pozo de Vida opened its first safehouse in 2010 with a total capacity of 12 girls. Over the course of seven years, we realized the need to grow into a larger home, as at one point we exceeded capacity by 22 victims. In 2016, we received a donation to purchase a new safehouse that can house up to 25 girls at one time. The purchase, repairs and remodel were completed in 2017 we moved in in May 2017. &nbsp; All victims placed in our refuge home are brought to us by the Mexican authorities or other institutions who make a referral with us, we never accept minors without government permission. Once in the safehouse, each survivor receives holistic, integral care which includes: food, shelter, clothing, counseling, medical attention, education and vocational training. Unlike other safehouses, there is no limit to the amount of time that beneficiaries can stay with us, and as many do not have healthy families or safe communities to go back to, they stay with us until they turn 18, where they have the option of going to our transition home or to live independently. &nbsp; The overall objective of the safehouse is to contribute to the healthy emotional, physical, intellectual, spiritual and social development of survivors of human trafficking, generating a dignified and safe space with integral and timely attention. The expected result of our program is to promote a healthy social reinsertion of our survivors by reducing their degree of vulnerability through training, education, and accompaniment in their individual process of empowerment. How your donation will be used: The goal of this campaign is to cover the remaining budget of 2018 and January 2019 as we wait for additional funding to be received in January 2019. Donations will be used to cover the general operating costs of running the home, staff salaries, food, clothing, maintenance, therapy and educational activities. As seen below, the cost per month per survivor ranges from $541 USD &#8211; $722 USD depending on the physical, emotional and social needs of each individual case.

And it&#8217;s part of Greater Santiago. Claudia Pizarro Peña, mayor, is the current maximum authority of the municipality. La Pintana has a population of more than 177 thousand inhabitants and is one of the 142 townships that have a high rate of social vulnerability for children and adolescents in Chile. The study by ONA (Observatory of Children and Adolescents) indicates that children in these communities have a high probability of interrupting their education and that three out of ten are living in multidimensional poverty. This study also indicates that children and adolescents are the most impoverished population in the country. The statistics of the South Metropolitan Prosecutor&#8217;s Office also adds that the environment of La Pintana, in which children and young people study and live, leads the crime rate in the southern area of Santiago stating that crimes against freedom and intimacy of individuals, interfamily violence and crimes against property are the most frequent. The problem in Chile: A society in social Crisis and very sick We are very concerned that despite the growth and economic stability that has led Chile to be considered one of the exemplary countries in the region and part of the list of nations of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), our country as a society is &#8220;in SOCIAL CRISIS and VERY SICK.&#8221; On the one hand, there is inequality, evident in social treatment, represented in the sexism and classism that triggers all kinds of undermining and discriminating experiences, rooted in the organizational history of the country, making Chile lead the ranking of most unequal countries of the OECD. And, on the other hand, there is the epidemic of overweight and school obesity, with a high prevalence and clear increase in recent decades, emerging as one of the countries that lead world rankings associated with the problem. Studies done by the Ministry of Health of Chile also indicate that this represents the second cause of a decrease in life expectancy or premature disability and the sixth cause of death nationwide. Our objective Through the teaching of the unique socio-educational values ​​of rugby, we want to EMPOWER the girls, boys and young students of La Pintana, developing skills that can be used by them to be successful in school, the community and to live healthy and active lives. At RPT Chile Foundation, we imagine a Chile where all people have equal opportunities to know, learn and practice the values of rugby in daily life such as: family, respect, passion, tolerance, teamwork, solidarity, trust, discipline, collective responsibility, sportsmanship, enjoyment, equality, integrity. Our mission is to advocate for the democratization of school rugby. Educate, inspire and empower girls, boys and adolescents to expand their opportunities and to be responsible citizens in their communities and the planet. Among the main components of this mission are: the introduction, enrichment and reinforcement of the social and educational values of rugby through learning and practicing this sport in an active and permanent way in establishments with state funding, vulnerable and scarce resources. To which specific Sustainable Development Goals do we aim? Goal 1: End of poverty Goal 3: Health and well-being Goal 4: Quality education Goal 5: Gender Equality Goal 13: Climate action HOW WILL YOUR DONATIONS BE PUT INTO ACTION? The main objective of this crowdfunding campaign is to collect eighty thousand American dollars (USD 80000) to cover the costs of eleven training workshops that will be imparted annually in the public schools of La Pintana. In addition, achieving this goal will leave us in a very good position to request and manage the pledge of funds made the local authorities, offering to finance 50 percent (USD 40 thousand) of the necessary funds to ensure the continuity of the annual program for the next two years. The estimated annual cost of each rugby workshop, per school, is seven thousand two hundred American dollars (USD 7200); as accumulated amounts of funds are reached, they will be destined towards the start-up of the workshops in school according to a priority list previously agreed upon alongside local authorities and school directors. WHY DOES IT MATTER? The training workshops of RPT Chile will help influence and positively impact the lives of more than three thousand (+3000) vulnerable students who currently attend public schools in the district of La Pintana, Chile. As part of the work methodology of the annual RPT Chile workshop, trained educators, teachers proficient in the methodology of RPT Chile, intervene public schools of chosen townships planning 14 units of workshops distributed in 38 weeks per year. Physical activity varies from 2 to 3 days per week, considering two classroom periods (90 minutes) per day this would contribute an additional 4 to 6 classroom periods of effective physical activity to the MINEDUC educational program. Four segments are considered in the annual formative stage, grouping 20 children (10 boys and 10 girls) per workshop. Students from 1st to 8th grade (6-14 years old) are grouped according to their motor skills and ages in these four segments of work. Using this sport as an active and permanent platform the introduction, enrichment and reinforcement of the social and educational values ​​of rugby through learning and play, are key factors in the success of the RugbyParaTodos Chile training workshop at a school stage. For example, soft skills such as communication, language, personal habits, friendship and optimism among others, are worked through physical activity. And socio-educational values ​​such as Respect, Discipline, Enjoyment, Sportsmanship, Collective Responsibility, Equality, and Teamwork are introduced and reinforced. How does our organization measure the impact of the project? Through the record of changes observed in the participants, the documentation of change stories that include case studies, visual media and interviews, compiled in a participatory manner, including the different partakers such as the participants themselves, parents and guardians, teachers and school directors and members of the community. Evaluating the impact of our interventions through comparative analysis of the data collected during the baseline and end-line surveys POTENTIAL CHALLENGES The most important challenge the foundation faces is to be able to carry out the training programs and count with the funds necessary to commit the annual work of the educators. As well as achieving the commitment of local authorities in the financing of at least fifty percent of the program for the subsequent years. How to collaborate and help? People and organizations can help in the following ways: Donations or gifts through the international Crowdfunding page or by depositing directly in the FUNDACION RUGBYPARATODOS CHILE account of Banco Estado de Chile number: 43370364614 Participating as official ambassadors of the campaign or volunteering in events and outreach activities Helping in the diffusion of the message and the campaign, sharing in social networks Using the HIPGive social sharing tools ABOUT OUR ORGANIZATION Fundación RugbyParaTodos Chile (RugbyForAll Chile Foundation) We are an Sport for Development and Peace (SDP) non-profit organization, which uses the power of sport as a tool in country development to improve lives, empower vulnerable communities of greater need and with few resources, and in this way, also support international development initiatives such as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) of the United Nations (UN). RUGBYPARATODOS los Colegios Públicos de Chile (Rugbyforall the Public Schools of Chile) Movement that emerged in 2015 and was recently constituted as a non-profit organization, we are actively involved with other organizations, working in the planning and development of clinics and educational workshops of physical activity to be taught in vulnerable establishments with high social risk students and that have been rejected by other schools. In these last years of work we achieved, together with the support of the family and friends of Rugby, that 312 public schools throughout Chile count with the sporting equipment necessary to learn rugby and that the Minister of Education and the Ministry of Education of Chile recognized rugby as a school sport and incorporate the rugby ball into the state purchase system. Our Challenge: Change a New Generation for the better Our first challenges: to seek recognition of the teaching and practice of Rugby and its different variations as a school sport, to be acknowledged by government authorities and to congregate as an organization and movement at a national and international level, have been achieved with great success. Our next challenge is to work on making the implementation and development of educational workshops RUGBYPARATODOS in public schools in Chile a reality. To achieve this successfully and efficiently, we need the help and collaboration of everyone: friends and families of the rugby community, local governments, private companies, public institutions, and government authorities, national and international social organizations that share our mission to improve lives making our efforts go even further.

Cali, a city that has been a meeting point for many people displaced by violence, has migrated to high risk areas where unhealthy habits have been generated, permeated by drug addiction, gang formation and criminal acts that do not allow the construction of a social fabric. Taking into account this, La Liga Vallecaucana de Rugby &#8211; LVR -, and its affiliated clubs interested in the development of people (children, youth and adults) intact, where sport is a path towards healthy living and the healthy life of all those that they approach, raises the creation of schools of infantile and juvenile formation for the sport discipline of Rugby. From the LVR is proposed as an objective: to promote and practice Rugby as a training element in children and youth of the different districts of the city of Cali, using free time in healthy activities and healthy living. &nbsp; The project is divided into three main stages: 1. Phase of Communication and Call 2. Stage of development of practices of Rugby Lawn 3. Evaluation phase. Each phase has a methodological development that will be carried out through the Area of ​​Development and Masification of the LVR. It is a multidisciplinary group that is responsible for presenting rugby as a tool for transformation to children, youth and adults in the city. In this group are executives, coaches, referees, reenactors, social communicators, publicists and engineers. And the support and donations would be directed for the payment of these people. The LVR has developed similar projects in the last 3 years thanks to the municipal institutions and its costs have ranged between US $ 12,000 and US $ 20,000 per project and this has made an impact on more than 1500 children and young people. This year, due to political and bureaucratic issues, the government institutions have not defined an order to support the massification projects of the leagues, including rugby. This is undoubtedly the main reason why we started this Crowdfunding campaign. The resources obtained through this platform will be allocated in this way: EXPECTED MONEY COLLECTION (US) $ 10,000.00 INVESTMENT AMOUNT(PERCENTAGE) Monitors (50%) $ 5,000.00 Managers (25%) $ 2,500.00 Meetings and Festivals (10%) $ 1,000.00 Advertising and Social Networks (10%) $ 1,000.00 Logistics and Planning (5%) $ 500.00 The investments are presented with percentage data to have references in what is intended to use the money so that the goal proposed in the project is not achieved. The number of monitors that is raised in this first project are 2, however, it may vary depending on the amount of money that is collected, likewise, in the management area would be a person in charge of the entire logistics, added to a person that generates the work of publicity and use of networks. Finally, the logistics and planning item refers to the planning time, transportation implementation and endowment, etc. This is the first time that we plan to use a Crowdfunding platform to support this type of projects in the LVR, however, we can assure that the money will be well invested for the fulfillment of the objective as it has been done in the past 3 years with the Government support. We strongly believe that Rugby is a means for the formation of integral people, that help to the construction of the social fabric that the developing countries so much need. The training in values ​​that is preached from the World Rugby, such as discipline, honesty, respect, solidarity, inclusion and fun are evident in Rugby players. We hope that the international community (whether or not a rugby player) believes that in the ideas we profess. Why it matters: Because in Colombian we need to transcend violence, crime, unhealthy habits, change the way of thinking, leave behind the easy way, stop looking for quick solutions without measuring the consequences. Cali has been a city constantly battered by drug trafficking, profiting from unscrupulous people and permeating the most needy, creating stereotypes of life without effort and through violence. We believe that rugby can change those people, change the mentality of a society accustomed to crime, we believe that the values ​​that Rugby professes are for inside the field and outside, that each subject understands the importance of others to achieve life projects We can not promise to change all the people who come to us, but if we assure that those in which we generate a change of mentality, they will be agents concerned about doing things well for their city, country or the whole planet. &nbsp; Technology and the speed of information have distanced us a little from human contact, it has assured us a small bubble of false confidence, and also children and young people are responding to the real world, without wanting to or trying to understand each other, every time It is easier to find emotional and psycho-social problems at younger ages, social skills have been diminished by the same overprotective vision generated by virtual media. Sport, specifically Rugby, which has fundamental elements for socialization, seeks to generate bonds between individuals, which constantly presents situations of joint solution and the importance of others. &nbsp; We thank all the people who can contribute monetarily with this cause, but we would also infinitely thank the rugby community, sports or those who are interested in social development that can replicate this message in their countries, acquaintances, philanthropists, etc. Rugby has taught us that we are all useful regardless of physical, social or economic characteristics, we believe that this platform shows it, there are endless ways that we can help others and through working together we can change the lives of less fortunate people. &nbsp;",,"Activity Description Unit of Measurement Quant Unit (USD) Total Value Technical and logistic coordinator In charge of carrying out, organizing and developing the massification project in Santiago de Cali. &nbsp; Month 6 $ 417 $ 2,500 Coach 2 coaches for each practice group in the communes at a rate of $ 417 per month Month 6 $ 833 $ 5,000 Communicator 1 Community Manager responsible for creating advertising, making press releases and use in virtual media Mensual 1 $ 700 $ 700 Advertising Banners and advertising banners with institutional logos Global 1 $ 300 $ 300 Logistics and Planning Transportation of implements, planning meetings, space rental.

Not long ago, Cibola was a private prison run by the infamous Corrections Corporations of America, or CCA, and was shut down due to medical violations. However, shortly after Trump took office, CCA rebranded themselves as CoreCivic, and Cibola reopened its doors as an immigrant detention center. It is also the only detention center in the country that has a pod dedicated to holding transgender immigrant women. &nbsp; Most of the transwomen detained in the Cibola facility have experienced significant trauma and discrimination in their home countries, often coming from rural areas in Mexico and Central America where they have been abused by family members, gangs, and law enforcement. Instead of finding refuge in the United States, these women are sent to a men’s immigrant prison where they often spend months waiting to fight their case court. While detained, it has been documented in numerous studies that LGBTQ populations face a much greater risk of experiencing sexual violence. &nbsp; The trans pod of immigrant women was relocated from a detention facility in southern California when the Cibola Correctional Center reopened in 2017 when activists shut down the facility. Now, these women face new barriers. The rural location of the Cibola County detention facility, language barriers, lack of knowledge of their rights, and the at times impossible tasks of affording an attorney reduce justice to an elusive fantasy for these women. &nbsp; We’re here to change that. &nbsp; A year ago, NMILC, in partnership with the Santa Fe Dreamers Project, launched a legal services program to provide support to the hundreds of immigrants detained in Cibola. Studies show that detained immigrants with an attorney are seven times as likely to win their case, so we work to ensure that every woman in Cibola receives the support of a pro bono attorney. We’re happy to report that in the past year, attorneys with the legal services program have won xx asylum cases, and &nbsp; We can’t continue this work without your help. &nbsp; Providing these services are expensive; a single asylum case can take 20 hours of attorney time, and transportation for our staff and volunteers to the rural center is costly. We want to raise enough money to keep this program going strong in the coming months and ensure more detained women in Cibola are able to experience the safety and freedom of resettling in the U.S. Please consider donating in any amount to help us continue the fight for trans* immigrant women detained in New Mexico. $2,500 would give us enough money to fund two asylum cases and a month&#8217;s worth of legal workshops at the Cibola County Detention Center. &nbsp;",,,,,ended,,,

El Centro Hispano needs to raise $14,670 to help students like Beatriz to fulfill their dreams of learning how to read and write in Spanish, and earn their elementary, middle and high school diplomas. Your donation will support 35 students with scholarships, and provide funds to cover cost and purchase materials for one school year. You can change the lives of many students like Beatriz, by supporting El Centro Hispano’s work. Help us give current and future adult learners second chance at life to advance themselves academically. With a changing Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill community and an evolving global economy, our students need a solid grasp of reading and writing to navigate through complex systems. For 18 years, El Centro Hispano has offered adult education classes to help adult Spanish speaking students finish their elementary, middle and high school education. We currently have a waitlist of students who could benefit from the adult education classes but can’t afford to do so. Help us overcome illiteracy! Having a solid grasp of literacy and numeracy is vital for our students’ everyday lives, to make informed decisions, and to interact with print material that can help them make informed decisions. The majority of our students did not finish school due to many obstacles, so we help them to complete school where they left off. Last year we graduated 19 students &#8211; One student learned how to read and to write, 6 students received their elementary school diplomas, while 12 students received their high school diplomas. As you grow, life throws obstacles your way. Many students like Beatriz, did not have the privilege to finish their formal education/schooling in their home countries. Now, our students will pursue higher-paying jobs, read to their children, and have more ease to navigate in systems that require reading fluency and number recognition. El Centro Hispanic has been serving the Latino Triangle Area community for over 25 years. Located in both Durham and Orange Counties, we served over 47,500 people last year through our Health &amp; Well-being, Community Engagement and Advocacy, Economic Development, and Education programs.

For $20, you can help a student receive necessary writing materials including notebooks,pens, and pencils. For $30, you can help a student buy his or her HiSET book. For $70 you help offset printing costs for one student during the whole academic year. For $120 you will provide a materials scholarship for a student to pay printing cost, study materials, and book. For $200, you can help fund the teacher for a week. For $800 you can help fund the teacher for a month. (Teacher is assisted by volunteers. If funding goals are not reached, El Centro Hispano will use the available money to cover as many scholarships as possible. To make up for the rest, students will have to pay out of pocket for their printing costs, their school supplies and their books. After coming to our adult education classes, Beatriz explained that she can now help her children finish their elementary school homework. Not only has she mastered some concepts to support her children finish homework. She now uses her graduation story to motivate her children to study.

This year, El Salvador has been strongly affected by extreme droughts. The crop that has been mostly affected is the corn. Due to the lack of water and the deterioration of the soil, retaining less moisture, corn has been unable to be fully formed or even dried, leaving millions in loss. Although agriculture in El Salvador seems to be one of the industries in which people earn little money, efforts will focus on providing farmers with the knowledge to be able to technify, innovate and create agricultural methods resistant to events caused by water scarcity and climate change. The aim is to reach communities through socio-environmental dialogue and mediation. In order that the techniques implemented can be applied not only in agricultural issues but in other situations that may arise in the future. As an organization we have the mission that the changes that are acquired can be passed from one community to another. To stay and grow including women, men, young and old people. As a foundation, we focus on promoting peace and preventing conflicts through our intervention processes. At a local level, we have observed and verified that problems related to the environment generates knowledge exchange. We know that El Salvador has much to offer and many opportunities for growth for all its inhabitants. We want Salvadorans to stop believing that the only opportunities they have are abroad.¡Knowing and taking care of the resources that the earth offers us, we expand our possibilities! &nbsp; Our main goal is divided in three aspects: KNOWLEDGE: Farmers will have the opportunity to learn new methods to mitigate the risks and losses in their crops, caused by climate change. COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION: through mutual organization and cooperation, young farmers will be able to respond to problems such as droughts or floods as a community. FOOD SECURITY: with the construction of rainwater collectors (geomembrane deposits for rainwater) and dew, farmers will be able to receive water in extreme weather events and, therefore, save their crops. &nbsp; How can you help us? We need $10,000, since the project consists of building 8 rainwater geomembranes and 10 dew collectors for 4 communities of farmers in the municipality of Tecoluca (Canton of Potrerillo, Canton of La Calletana, Community of Nueva Tehuacán, Community of Monte Sinaí) . An important part in the realization of this project will be to generate knowledge for the response to climate change through dialogue spaces and the creation of an early warning system for crops. &nbsp; This is why the project it&#8217;s so important to us: The municipality of Tecoluca has been severely affected by climate change. The main problem faced by farmers every day is the lack of water, causing losses in their crops. The Tehuacán Park spring has fallen from 9L / s to 0.1L / s in its water stream. Farmers do not know any kind of techniques or methods to mitigate the effects of climate change on their crops, causing food shortages. As an organization we have worked on several projects always for the benefit of the community, we focus on practicing some dialogue techniques and we like to promote the importance of teamwork, Our main focus is Salvadorans, we bet on young people, by giving them the necessary knowledge, so they can continue to develop the community. &nbsp; This is our execution plan: Strategic installation of rainwater collection system and dew. Systems designs. Meetings with farmers for the development of a committee and its organization. Development of workshops. Creation of an early warning instrument. &nbsp; This is what we hope to achieve with your help: 8 rainwater collectors and 10 dew collectors, with which it is intended to supply water to crops (corn and beans).

While the effects of carbon dioxide levels that have accumulated since the Industrial Revolution will take many years to reverse, we believe it is time to demonstrate that it is possible, without altering the ecosystem and with a relatively low investment: a) A Food self-sufficiency and surplus for commercialization in local markets; (b) sufficient supply in the collection of fresh water for human consumption; (c). Electricity generation through renewable energies; and (d) Most importantly, to demonstrate that collective initiatives that rescue traditional knowledge, which can be replicated. The project is relevant to our association, because it will allow to develop alternatives for a better orientation of the investment of social funds. The project will be developed in a land of just over one hectare in the Mesophyll forest region of the municipality of Teocelo, Veracruz. It consists of a multi-purpose room, three cabins for visitor accommodation, a cellar and an office area, which will occupy an area of three hundred square meters; It will also allocate five hundred square meters for a camping area and bathrooms. An area of three hundred square meters will be destined for the cultivation of vegetables and in a hundred square meters a cultivation of vegetables by aquaponics. In 300 square meters one hundred hens will be raised for the production of organic egg. Nowadays banana, lime, lemon and coffee are produced, however, it is necessary to maintain, since in the last thirty years the terrain has not been cultivated. All the constructions will be built with traditional local materials (bamboo and mud) and the generation of electricity will be made with solar energy. For a better use of the fruit that is produced, a solar dehydrator will be installed. Dry toilets will be counted, which will avoid the incorrect disposition of excreta. The grey waters will be treated by means of aquatic cultures and slow infiltration, which avoids the contamination of the groundwater mantles. With the foregoing, in a synthetic way, we want to achieve: Develop processes of adaptation to climate change. Reduce the risk of disasters by mass removal processes in hillside areas. Consolidate a productive project within three years. Stimulate small landowners to generate similar projects that, in addition to promoting regional development, propel the municipality as a tourist destination. To promote educational processes for the domestic production of vegetables, composting of organic waste and, to the extent of the possibilities, to create backyard farms. In addition, we want to rescue traditional knowledge, so we will create workspaces for older adults for the maintenance of crops. We are searching for a fund of $121,400.00 (one hundred twenty-one thousand four hundred pesos 00/100) for the first stage of the project to be held from June to December 2018: Topographic survey with level curves at a meter and demarcation of the terrain: $8,000.00 Fenced with poles and three rows of barbed wire for the perimeter of the terrain that totals five hundred linear meters: $18,400.00 Thousand five hundred meters of wire $3.140 One hundred and fifty oaks or oak poles oiled $12.000 Four kilos of staples to fix wire $260.00 Labor.

Design of the architectural and constructive project. Includes supervision of the work: $15,000.00 5. Economic support for a quantity of $1,000.00 monthly for six months, for five elderly adults, with knowledge in the production of the field for the maintenance of the vegetables: $60,000.00 in case of not reaching the fixed goal, the resources Obtained will be invested in the order indicated above. As a benefit our donors, for every $1,000.00 (one thousand pesos) will be able to stay in our farm-school, one night, from May 2019. The success of this project will demonstrate that actions to adapt to climate change, in addition to not requiring millions of investments, ensure food self-sufficiency for project members, generate surpluses for the Marketing in local markets through a fair trade scheme, as well as reducing the risk of disasters by minimizing erosion. For the measurement of the advance is part of a baseline zero because the terrain in which the project will be developed has been without cultivation in the last thirty years. In another order of ideas, we want to point out that Redesccubre, A.C. has an experience of twenty-two years in the development of programs of risk management, being this project a decisive step to demonstrate that to return the view to the field, is the engine that will allow to influence In the effects of climatic variability.

UU.",Texas,San Antonio,,US Midwest,"Please support the Esperanza this Giving Tuesday on 11.27.18 to raise $10,000 for our new Museo del Westside!","Campaign summary: Before we embark on rehabilitating our historic property, Ruben’s Ice House, to create the first community museum in San Antonio’s predominantly Mexican American Westside, we would like to hire a team of consultants to assist in educating community members, Esperanza staff, board, and volunteers about museum planning and best practices in the rehabilitation of a historic building into a functional museum space. The consultants would also work with the Esperanza to develop a rehabilitation plan that meets the community’s desires for the space. This project will create a community-informed plan to rehabilitate a historic structure to give it a new life as a community serving museum, while also educating the community, staff, and board about the challenges of and best practices for rehabilitating a historic structure. The project will foster community knowledge about the building and its surroundings, build community buy-in for the future of the building, and further promote an understanding of and appreciation for community history in the Westside. A series of three to five community meetings will be convened (this will depend on the community’s expressed needs) to introduce the community, Esperanza staff, and board to the museum planning process and receive the community’s input on desired amenities, activities, and programs that will need to be incorporated into the design. Three consultants will be engaged: one an expert in rehabilitating historic buildings into museums, one an architect, and one a structural engineer. The latter two previously assisted in rehabilitating the other two designated structures on the property and are familiar with our organization’s commitment to community input. Donations will help us cover the costs of hiring the consultants – all experts in the ir respective fields. &nbsp; Why it matters: We anticipate holding the first community input meeting in mid-January with additional community meetings through March. Therefore, we anticipate strong community participation in these meetings with anywhere from 30 to 40 core participants. Our target audience is current and former Westside residents. San Antonio’s Westside is part of the city’s original 36 square miles and is an area notable for its unique working class vernacular architecture, deep ties to San Antonio’s Mexican American history, and as the birthplace of numerous Mexican American leaders, politicians, musicians, educators, writers, and artists. It originally began on the west side of downtown at the San Pedro Creek and spread west, but in the 1950s and 60s urban renewal and the building of Interstate 10 pushed the inhabitants of the Westside further west so that it now extends west from Interstate 10. Since the city’s earliest days the Westside has been predominately Mexican American, though new immigrant groups have also historically had enclaves in the Westside including early 20th century Syrian/Lebanese and Chinese immigrants. The Mexican Revolution (1910-1920) led to a surge of refugees fleeing to San Antonio and settling on the Westside. These refugees brought a renewed wave of Mexican cultural practices and pride to the Westside. Marked by small businesses selling traditional Mexican goods, churches serving a number of denominations, and houses often built by the hands of master builders with no architectural plans, the Westside retains a unique quality that as we say in San Antonio is “puro San Anto.” Westside residents are proud of their community, and especially proud of the people that have come from the Westside, including: former US Secretary for Housing and Urban Development Henry Cisneros, voting rights advocate Willie Velasquez, and international singer Eva Garza. The Westside also produced the iconic “Westside Sound” (Rudy &amp; the Reno Bops, The Royal Jesters, etc.), which has been documented a Smithsonian traveling exhibit. While the Westside remains one of the most culturally rich communities in San Antonio it is also one of the economically poorest, with forty-one percent of residents living in poverty. Though the Westside has been studied by historians, cultural geographers, sociologists, and others, outside of academia the impact and meaning of the Westside has rarely been told by the community or for the community. The Museo del Westside aims to correct this pattern. Outcomes will include strong community buy-in for the museum, increased community understanding of the museum’s benefits to the neighborhood, and community commitment to the future success of the museum. For the final product of this planning project, the consultants will work with our staff and board to develop a rehabilitation plan that meets the community’s desires for the space and that can be used to solicit construction bids. To ensure that we have met our goals we will ask the community participants to sign off on the final We’ve already held multiple community meetings (across multiple constituencies in the neighborhood) to introduce the idea of the museum and collect future exhibit ideas. We have been met by much enthusiasm from community members as it is widely known in the community that the Westside is one of San Antonio’s most historic neighborhoods and yet it is largely overlooked by larger cultural institutions. By bringing in a panel of expert consultants we will give the Westside the professional attention it deserves. We have already had great success in promoting the idea of the museum. To date we have held three community meetings next door to Ruben’s Ice House and presented at four meetings of other Westside organizations and have been met with great. We’ve already been contacted by multiple community members who want to donate family artifacts to the museum, including a hand-sewn stage dress worn by the international singer Refugio &#8221;Cuquita&#8221; Wilton Luna, La Reina del Microfono, and a large neon sign that once graced the 2-story, 15-room maternity home run by Westside midwife Romana Ramos. We opened our first Westside history exhibit on September 22, 2018 at the community room of the nearby public housing development and welcomed over 150 community members to the opening reception. We are very confident in the community’s desire for more such exhibits and a space to call their own that honors the community’s history. The Museo del Westside project is being overseen by Dr. Sarah Zenaida Gould, a Latina museum professional with over 10 years’ experience in the museum field. Previously, the Esperanza Peace &amp; Justice Center has raised over $1.2 million to rehab the historic Westside structures known as Casa de Cuentos (now a community gathering space) and Lerma’s Nite Club (a National Register of Historic Places listed building that was the longest-running conjunto club in Texas), as well as to erect a compressed earth (adobe) structure to house a Westside women’s clay art collective. Potential Challenges: &nbsp; The funds will cover consultant fees for a museum building rehabilitation expert, and architect, and structural engineer. All have experience working with community groups for project input, and community engagement with the process is of utmost importance to us, so we want to be sure to hire the right consultants for this project. In total their fees will be $10,000. We are also seeking $500 to cover meals and supplies for the community meetings. If we don’t reach our entire goal, we will reduce reduce the number of community meetings to however many we can afford. We are also applying for private grants to help with the costs, but do not know yet if we will receive any additional support at this time.

Everyone deserves to experience these things and lead a fulfilling and resilient life even when times are hard&#8211;unfortunately not everyone gets this opportunity. Within the Latino and LGBTQ communities, there is a population that is often overlooked by greater society:&nbsp;Gay Latino Men over the age of 55. For various reasons and circumstances, these older gay men are much more prone to experience mental health symptoms of&nbsp;loneliness, isolation and depression. Some of these factors include: living with HIV or other chronic health conditions living alone and/or in lackluster housing such as shelters being undocumented and experiencing fear related to their status living far away from their closest family and relatives; often in their home countries inability to pay for extracurricular activities due to low-wage employment coming out as gay at a later age For many of these men who come to Bienestar Human Services, attending our weekly support groups or counseling sessions with our staff are their only&nbsp;refuge. While we provide much needed support and care to these men, once they leave our doors and go home, they often return to these hard-to-overcome feelings of isolation and loneliness. The Solution: With your help, we will work to help build a strong network among these men that can foster the long-lasting, substantial friendships, relationships and personal growth to overcome some of these experiences of mental health symptoms that they so often relate to us. Money raised through this campaign will allow us to coordinate community-building and social bonding activities and programs for these men, encompassing multiple facets of our lives for a holistic approach to improving health &amp; well-being: Arts &amp; Culture:&nbsp;art and history museum visits; learning how to paint, draw or write; participating in arts workshops Appreciation of Nature:&nbsp;hikes in nature; visits to the mountains, ocean, beach Mentorship &amp; Teaching:&nbsp;imparting wisdom onto younger generations through mentor-mentee pairings Community Service:&nbsp;volunteering together with other nonprofit organizations for the community Leadership &amp; Advocacy:&nbsp;meeting with local legislators to share their stories &amp; advocate for themselves and others Friendship/Relationship Building:&nbsp;social activities including community meals; team-building exercises and workshops Health &amp; Wellness:&nbsp;education and information about mental health and other relevant wellness topics for these men LGBTQ Identity:&nbsp;engage in important discussions and talks about the challenges and assets of being an older gay Latino man This is important to us at Bienestar as our mission is to uplift the health &amp; well-being of the Latino community and other underserved communities. By building community with these men, we hope to fulfill our mission by helping them live more fulfilling, healthy lives. Are you ready to help us build community? Any donation&#8211;no matter how big or small&#8211;means more than the world to us! Why This Is So Important: Many older gay Hispanic men have to overcome unique challenges and obstacles in their lives in order to live openly gay in a society that accepts them. Many of the men we support are undocumented immigrants who traveled to the U.S. on their own in order to live in a country where they can identify as gay. Often, their family members in Mexico or other Latin American countries don&#8217;t accept their sexual orientation or the fact that they may be HIV positive, or are unaware due to fear and stigma. Because of their status, they are much more likely to work in low-paying jobs just to survive&#8211;they often did not get access to higher education, professional opportunities or the chance to learn English fluently in order to excel financially. Due to these circumstances, it is no wonder that compared to the general LGBT population, LGBT Hispanic older men are far more likely to experience mental health problems. Due to these consequences, later life depression is an important public health problem. It is associated with increased risk of suicide, self-neglect, decreased physical, cognitive and social functioning all of which contribute to increased mortality. To overcome these issues, it is crucial to have a support network including: community, friends and family who share values, trust and cooperation in order to achieve a true sense of well-being and optimal health for aging Latinos who are coping with isolation or loneliness. How You Can Help: Any donation&#8211;no matter how big or small&#8211;means more than the world to us! As part of the&nbsp;#SALUD4ALL Campaign, The California Endowment has made $10,000 available in matching funds to participating organizations. If you would like the opportunity to have your donation to our project matched, then please give on: Thursday, June 28th at 12pm PST and Tuesday, July 10th at 12pm PST. For example, if you give $25 on that day, at that time, then it is likely your donation will be matched, making it worth a total of $50! All of the funds donated to this campaign will go toward community-building and social bonding activities for these older men including opportunities to experience: nature, museums, community service, mentorship, meetings with local politicians, and so much more&#8211;as part of a unified community of people just like themselves.

When I met Dr. Felix and his team of colleagues at the Moctezuma Hospital form Children in México City, I realized all the challenges the hospital had to manage in order to help the children&#8221;. &nbsp; &#8220;One day, Dr. Felix told me that intravenous paracetamol was required to help some children but to my surprise, this is not the one that is administered by the hospital since it only can offer it in the form of pills. That was the moment when I said to myself that the lack of medication should never be the cause of the death of a child treated in a hospital.&#8221; &nbsp; As a personal challenge, that is, of a Mexican woman from the Jewish community, I would like to return to Mexico, to her children, everything that this wonderful country has to given to us. We would like to thank that Mexico has always welcome us and for that reason, we feel that it is our duty to help what is most important: the future of Mexico. &nbsp; The future of Mexico should not depend whether on if one is born in a family with financial resources or not. &nbsp; CAMPAIGN SUMMARY: &nbsp; We will not let poverty be a reason for not following the most important dream of all: being alive. In many cases, poverty has become the main factor for losing hope in the treatment of children´s health in many hospitals of Mexico. &nbsp; One of the main problems that Mexico faces due to poverty is the limitation of access to medical services. in many cases, due to the lack of studies, the type of illness or cancer that each child suffers is not known, which makes them choose to give the same medication to everyone, making their recovery more painful and slower, this is compounded by the side effects of a chemotherapy that is hair loss, causing children to lose their self-esteem. &nbsp; We want our children to receive treatments in decent conditions by providing them with medicines, medical studies, wigs for hair loss and ludotherapies that help them to have an accompaniment and stability through the game, building a means to explore and interact with their environment. &nbsp; LIFE DREAMS: &nbsp; With our project life dreams we seek to improve the quality of life of children during their treatments by providing Medical studies to improve accuracy of treatment Medical treatments that are not covered by the hospital Access to medicines that the hospital lacks Ludotherapy Accompaniment and emotional stability for the parents of the children. &nbsp; OUR IMPACT: &nbsp; From 2016 to 2018, we have helped 186 children between 2 months and 18 years of which, more than 70% suffered from cancer. In 2018, we want to help 80 children more and for this reason, we need your help.

In California, approximately half of all children have an immigrant parent, which means that every day, nearly half of California’s parents are fearing more and more for their and their children’s health and well-being. Alongside our community and school partners, TCP decided to host a series of community forums to connect with families and respond to questions or concerns about their child’s health care. We also teamed up with our immigration partners to address questions on immigration and how it impacts eligibility, enrollment, and the ability to get care. Continued federal attacks on immigrant families, such as the decision on DACA, a potential Executive Order on Public Charge, and a federal lawsuit against California’s sanctuary laws have created an environment of fear and instability. Many families are anxious about their and their children’s health coverage and there is a chilling effect preventing families from applying for coverage for which they are eligible or seeking services, especially immigrant families, who are disproportionately uninsured. What is Let&#8217;s Talk? TCP’s Let’s Talk forums were designed to directly respond to immigrant families’ concerns and help organize and empower communities so they are equipped with the right tools to protect their care and understand information impacting health access and coverage. We partner with our ALL IN for Health Campaign partnerships with the California Department of Education, community health centers, and immigrant organizations to host Let’s Talk forums and disseminate materials. Because schools are trusted sources of information for families, we work with schools as venues. We utilize our proven strategy of leveraging community partners’ relationships with families, and with each other, to provide multi-sector and targeted local resources. How Can You Help? With the current Administration, there are always new threats to children’s rights to health and safety. We must do our due diligence to make sure families have resources and up-to-date information, as well as hear directly from families about their needs. In order to meet this challenge, we plan to expand our Let’s Talk forums into additional priority communities, focusing on previously identified regions where there is a healthcare discrepancy and where area demographics reflect the diversity of California’s children. We have received some preliminary grant funding to help support this expansion, but we need your help to supplement the costs and are asking for $3,000 in support. We plan to reach at least 200 immigrant families directly with new Let’s Talk presentations as part of this expansion, with an additional 800 through disseminated materials. Thank You! With your help and amidst the chaos, mistreatment, and misinformation, we can provide families with in-person enrollment assistance, immigration legal services, access to local healthcare providers, and more importantly, a space to feel heard.

Potential Challenges: We want to overcome the barrier of entry into the world of cyber for our youths and are working to ensure the Cyber Summer Camps remain completely free for them.&nbsp; There is a projected shortfall of over 2 million job applicants for cyber workforce related jobs by 2020. &nbsp;With such a shortage in cyber workforce and an even larger shortage of women and minorities in cyber, we think part of the solution is reaching them all much younger.&nbsp; Our Cyber Summer Camps will be hosted in underserved communities and free for all children to attend!&nbsp; While our funding request of $15,000.00 would be impactful and welcome, it represents only a small fraction of the support needed.&nbsp; We are able to receive donations through&nbsp;https://crri.us/funding/&nbsp;and through HIPGIVE!&nbsp; We are a &#8220;lean&#8221; nonprofit, as we maintain low overhead and few employees, in order to remain agile in delivering impactful solutions.

The need for trained interpreters was first identified when migrant farmworkers would suffer injustices in healthcare and legal settings because they spoke neither Spanish nor English. Now, the most urgent need is for indigenous migrants stuck in the US detention system. They are quickly becoming the majority of detainees, but neither the government agencies, nor the language service companies know how to make language services a reality for detainees.&nbsp; Most people working with detainees think that indigenous languages are dialects of Spanish, which they aren&#8217;t. Interviews with detainees show that most are simply not getting interpreters who speak their languages. Indigenous organizations like CIELO and FIOB understand the languages, the cultures, and the particular problems that indigenous people face in detention. And rather than checking an empty box, they put delivering a real service to their brothers and sisters at the heart of their work. Every week, a trained interpreter can offer dozens if not hundreds of detainees the possibility of communicating with advocates and judges, while at the same time making a living wage. &nbsp; Each donation will be put to use. CIELO is actively seeking additional supporters for this project. All funds raised will have an impact in convening an interpreter training. $5 can cover one person&#8217;s ride in a shared rideshare. $15 can cover a meal for a workshop participant. Larger donations will cover airfare so that speakers of the most-needed languages can fly to Los Angeles from their home states. To donors of over $150, CIELO will send a thank-you perk of a hand made embroidered blouse from Oaxaca. If you can&#8217;t donate, but want to support indigenous interpreters, you can spread the word about the urgent need described here. &nbsp; Detainees need trained interpreters, in their languages. Indigenous organizations like CIELO and FIOB understand the need and are working to meet the need.

The jeep flipped, ejecting Maria’s daughter, who died from her injuries. Maria’s leg was badly injured &#8212; but, when Immigration and Customs Enforcement brought her in for processing, she didn’t receive the prompt specialty care she needed for the severity of her wounds. As a result, her wounds festered. Maria couldn’t walk, and her pro-bono attorney feared she would lose the leg. Luckily, Maria’s attorney called Medical Review for Immigrants (MRI). A new initiative from the non-profit Migrant Clinicians Network, MRI mobilizes health care providers to assist attorneys with clients like Maria who have urgent medical necessities that are dangerously undertreated while in detention. Through MRI, a physician is mobilized to quickly provide a Letter of Declaration for an attorney to request humanitarian parole for a seriously ill immigrant client, which enables the client to be released to receive essential care. Once released, MRI then assures that the client reaches the treatment she needs, with records transfer, follow-up services, and case management. MRI leans on MCN’s clinical network of over 10,000 constituents and over 30 years of experience working with health care providers coast to coast, and utilizes MCN’s Health Network, a proven cost-effective bridge case management system for patients who are moving while needing ongoing care. Within 24 hours, a physician had conducted the necessary medical records review and written a letter certifying medical need, and Maria was released. She immediately flew to California with her attorney, where Maria was reunited with her aunt, the only family she had in the US. MRI identified clinicians in the region through our network and quickly found emergency specialty providers who were willing to give her the care she needed to avoid leg amputation. Within two days of being released on humanitarian parole, Maria was on her way to recovery &#8212; thanks to MRI. Without MRI, she may have lost her leg &#8212; or her life. Why It’s Important: Thousands of immigrants seeking asylum arrive at the border each month, fleeing war, poverty, violence, and discrimination. Our clinical network reports to us that many of these immigrants have urgent health needs, like Maria’s, that are going unmet. &nbsp;Exacerbated by a dangerous and long migration, often precipitated by a lifetime of toxic stress and traumatic events, and sometimes the direct result of violence in their homelands, these illnesses and injuries can be debilitating and deadly &#8212; and they are too often overlooked while in detention. A new Human Rights Watch report uncovered “subpar and dangerous practices” that constitute “systemic deficits in immigration detention facility health care.” All people deserve access to quality health services. No one deserves to die in detention because of lack of access to care. With over 30 years of experience of technical assistance, networking, support services, case management, and training for migrant clinicians, Migrant Clinicians Network has a proven track record to overcome barriers to assure immigrants can access the health care they need. Our Goal: Our goal is to formalize and scale up MRI by mobilizing our nationwide network of physicians to help patients like Maria who are in ICE custody but have advanced medical needs. &nbsp;The process is threefold. Many of the immigrants in custody need humanitarian parole, under which they are released from detention so that their health needs, which have gone unmet in detention, can be addressed. These are often urgent requests, needing a physician’s review within 48 to 72 hours, and requiring an advanced and formal network of physicians to assure prompt response. Once released, immigrants encounter numerous barriers to care &#8212; language, transportation, culture and religion, insurance and financial concerns &#8212; and, through MRI, we will utilize our nationwide network to help them overcome barriers to get the treatment they need. To inaugurate the formal MRI, MCN will alert pro-bono immigration agencies, law centers, and trusted private immigration attorneys of the review service, and mobilize a network of concerned physicians willing to learn the specifics of: reviewing medical records; the development of Letters of Declaration; and case management and patient navigation with Health Network support. MCN will provide training and ongoing support to clinicians in this network. But we need nationwide support to assure that we can meet these needs. We have the network, the will, the expertise &#8212; but we don’t have the funding to make it happen. Your donations go directly to build and mobilize our network of clinicians and attorneys to help immigrants with unmet health needs get out of detention and into care. *Name, location, and other details are altered to protect the identity of the patient. The Impact: Many of us are watching with disbelief as the populations at &nbsp;for-profit detention facilities balloon.&nbsp; Immigrants who are fleeing for their lives arrive at the US border to claim asylum, only to be detained for upwards of 400 days at overcrowded prisons and repurposed WalMarts. As members of affected communities, we are horrified to see the lack of humanity on the part of ICE. As clinicians, we fear that many of those detained are not getting the basic health services they need. &nbsp;At a time when it feels like there is so little we can do to help those at the border, this project is a concrete way to help detained immigrants with health concerns to get out of detention and into care. Hundreds of immigrants in detention need care &#8212; and detention facilities are not providing it. Recent reports outline the inadequacy of medical care in ICE facilities. Simultaneously, the Trump Administration seeks to increase capacity at these facilities while cutting funding. This project will mobilize physicians to help those immigrants to get humanitarian parole and to access quality health care at their new location. In addition, hundreds of physicians are watching the news and wishing they could do more. This network will enable physicians to make a measurable impact on the lives of immigrants fleeing violence and war and seeking a better life. The impact is easily measurable: how many patients received humanitarian parole, and how many were able to complete treatment for illnesses and injuries that would otherwise go untreated. MCN’s Success: For more than 30 years, Migrant Clinicians Network has equipped clinicians with practical solutions uniquely tailored to the needs of the community by accounting for both its poverty and mobility. MCN brings together clinicians serving the mobile poor, providing technical assistance, training, resources, and tools to the clinicians serving migrants on the frontlines.&nbsp;In 2017 alone, we provided 22,639 clinical encounters to clinicians across the US. For this project, we will mobilize our over 10,000 constituents to create a strong network of physicians who can provide documentation for humanitarian parole. MCN also fills the gaps in migrant health. For two decades, MCN’s Health Network has provided bridge case management, records transfer, and follow-up services for any migrant with an ongoing health need who is on the move. Last year, we completed 1,782 cases &#8212; that’s almost two thousand people who were sick but needed to move and otherwise wouldn’t have been able to continue their treatment. Health Network talks directly with the patient, finds a new clinic, sets up appointments, and assures that the patient can continue treatment, be it for a pregnancy, cancer, tuberculosis, or any other health concern. Health Network has assisted migrant patients in every state in the US and in 114 other countries. And it’s cost-effective: independent research has shown that Health Network is highly cost-effective for migrant patients receiving treatment for tuberculosis infection. We will utilize Health Network to assure that patients who receive humanitarian parole can access culturally competent and high-quality care at their next destination, despite numerous barriers like lack of health insurance, unfamiliarity with the community’s resources, and language differences. What will funds cover? Your much-needed donations have a tangible result: immigrants with urgent medical health needs will get out of detention and into care. With these funds, Migrant Clinicians Network will build the basic infrastructure of MRI, beginning with outreach to physicians and pro-bono immigration agencies, law centers, and trusted private immigration attorneys across the country. Your donations will allow us to train physicians to properly write Letters of Declaration and to bring clinicians together virtually for a community of learning to help overcome potential hurdles. Finally, your donations will fund the case management needed to find and coordinate ongoing health care for patients after they are released &#8212; an essential next-step after a patient receives humanitarian parole through MRI. All funds will go to the development of MRI. The faster we reach our goal, the more quickly we can begin helping immigrants with health needs get out of detention and into the care they need.

EBSC works with the most marginalized populations who are fleeing violence and persecution, including Unaccompanied Minors; torture victims; victims of gender-based violence; and LGBTQ people. Our participants come from over 60 countries. Our legal services, community organizing, and solidarity work have evolved in direct response to community needs. Current campaign priorities are focused on 1) Helping asylum seekers and 2) Creating a pathway to permanent residency for holders of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) &#8211; a legal status for people from countries facing intense unrest such as civil war and natural disasters. Why Saving TPS Matters: Saving TPS will protect 270,000 US citizen children from being separated from their families. Protecting TPS will help 440,000 people from 13 countries who are currently risk of being deported back to dangerous and war-torn nations. Many TPS holders have been living in the United States for over 20 years. They pay US taxes, have children with US citizenship, and make valuable contributions to their community, workplace, and overall economy. They are law-abiding and hard-working members of our communities. TPS began as a program for Salvadorans who sought refuge from a brutal civil war. 93% of TPS holders are from El Salvador, Honduras, and Haiti. In October 2018, a federal judge granted a temporary injunction to protect TPS. However, we still need a legislative solution to provide permanent residency for TPS holders. How Your Donation Helps: A small donation of just $25 will help us provide legal help and community support to our clients and their families: $25 &#8211; supports one person to learn about their legal rights and social services $50 &#8211; supports one TPS holder to participate in a Know Your Rights Forum $100 &#8211; supports 5 people to participate in a civics class to become U.S. citizens $300 &#8211; supports one day of legal screening in our Walk-in Clinic Other Ways You Can Help: Unable to make a donation?

It transcends differences of language, of country of origin, of geography. It unites us in a way that only the most dire of emergencies can. It is a crisis of humanity, one that requires a basic, human response: Heart. For decades, Alianza Americas has worked across borders to fight injustice, oppression, and inequality. And as the crisis facing migrant families, children, and marginalized people across the Americas grows, the urgency and immediacy of our work also grows. Join us in putting our “hearts”&#8211;resources, action, compassion and resistance&#8211;on the ground, across borders to protect migrant families and defend their human rights. &nbsp; How we will put your donations in action: #HeartsAcrosstheAmericas will work across borders to protect and defend migrant families in their home countries, along the migration route, and in the United States. The effort builds on Alianza Americas’ 15 years of experience in transnational advocacy and organizing to advance justice, dignity and human rights across the Americas.- In Central America: Coordinated advocacy, resources, and partnerships to end the systemic violence, impunity, and inequality driving families from their homes. In Mexico: Direct financial support to shelters housing migrant families and mobilization of legal experts to ensure that families understand their rights to seek asylum. In the United States: Networked legal services and know-your-rights trainings for migrant families and migrant-led organizing around legislation that protects families across borders. Add your “heart” to the mobilization of #HeartsAcrosstheAmericas. Your donation will support Alianza Americas’ transnational effort to build safety, support and protections migrant families across borders. &nbsp; Why it matters: Central American families and migrant communities are in acute crisis. The systemic poverty, corruption and violence that plagues countries like Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and Nicaragua has been exacerbated by decades of short-sighted, punitive economic and immigration policies from the United States. And now, the abject lack of basic regard for humane treatment with which the current administration has attacked immigrant and refugee families puts them at immediate risk. The resurgence of white supremacy, rising xenophobia, and nationalism is reaching across borders, adding to this toxic mix across the Americas. Families face death if they stay home; persecution and separation if they flee. &nbsp; Potential Challenges: Well-intentioned, short-term responses fail to capture the deeply historic and transnational dimensions of the challenge at hand. While there is no silver bullet to tackling a situation as complex as the one facing Central American migrants, work toward a solution must include all stakeholders across the U.S.-Central America migration corridor. In defending migrant families, we seek support from concerned people across the Americas. Share your city, state, and country when you make a contribution to light up our map of #HeartsAcrosstheAmericas. &nbsp; About our organization Alianza Americas is a network of 50 immigrant-led organizations representing more than 100,000 families across the United States.

Over the years, our agency has evolved into a family resource center that provides a range of services to help community members successfully integrate into society. The Speaking Spanish Citizens&#8217; Foundation core services are Educational Enrichment, Youth Leadership, Immigration &amp; Citizenship Services and Information &amp; Referral. Read more about us at sscf.org. The Issue: Adolescence can be a time of both disorientation and discovery. This transitional period can bring up issues of independence and self-identity; many adolescents and their peers face tough choices regarding schoolwork, sexuality, drugs, alcohol, and social life. Going through this phase can be hard for Latino teenagers living in a foreign country. The Spanish Speaking Citizens’ Foundation provides integral educational services to motivate youth in becoming the best version of themselves. Healthy Food, Healthy Youth is a part of the Spanish Speaking Citizens’ Foundation’s educational programs, a strategic and complementary effort to our tutoring and mentoring support program for Latino teenagers. We want to hire a nutritionist to teach students healthy eating habits to help them choose the best food options according to their budget and their nutritional needs, while at the same time learning how to cook! In the United States, more children suffer from malnutrition due to dietary imbalances than due to nutritional deficiencies. We at SSCF have had the opportunity to work with 70 Latino high school students offering them comprehensive and integral education through our LIBRE program. Besides the academic support and cultural activities, ten of them they will be educated on healthy eating habits this fall thanks to the complementary Healthy Food, Healthy Youth program. We need your help to get started! We need only $2,500 to make the Healthy Food, Healthy Youth program a reality, and we really believe that a crowdfunding campaign is the best way to reach our goal; promotional support and donations from dedicated individuals could easily finance this great project. Once the Healthy Food, Healthy Youth program concludes, students will have the opportunity to practice every day at home, teach other members of their families what they learned, and when possible, they will cook with their friends at our center as a part of our educational program. Eating healthy is an important part of a healthy lifestyle and is something that should be taught at a young age. Healthy eating during adolescence is important as the body changes during this time, affecting an individual&#8217;s nutritional and dietary needs. Adolescents are becoming more independent and making many food decisions on their own. Many adolescents experience a growth spurt and an increase in appetite and need healthy foods to meet their growth needs.

We’ve identified a challenge in Guatemala: organizations working on similar development challenges lack constant, efficient communication to collaborate on efforts. Organizations with similar goals—for instance, to reduce chronic child malnutrition, tackle a particular disease, support primary or secondary education, among others—tend to work independently due to not knowing about the other’s work or lacking effective means of articulating efforts together. This lack of collaboration often results in a duplicity of efforts and inefficient use of resources, a significant barrier to optimizing the existing social efforts to tackle development challenges in Guatemala. &nbsp; How will GuateMapa improve social impact? We create networks organized around the same development goal and facilitate communication among organizations to: &#8211; promote the exchange of useful information to coordinate efforts, &#8211; share good practices and lessons learned, &#8211; catalyze innovation, &#8211; organize common fundraising activities, among numerous other initiatives. &nbsp; Your donation will help support these networks to ensure the efficient use of resources and avoid duplicity of efforts, thus optimizing the social impact of organizations in Guatemala.

Our mission is to close the gap between data and social development programs by cultivating a dynamic, interrelated and ethical research ecosystem that informs sustainable, impactful Guatemalan development. &nbsp; We are the backbone of innovative development projects that showcase Guatemala’s strengths and catalyze lasting change. Our work creates links between Guatemalans of all ages, social classes, and ethnicities and consequently builds a stronger nation. We have worked on two GuateMapa projects to date: a national open-data platform for organizations working to reduce rates of chronic child malnutrition and a group of organizations working on preventing and treating cleft lift and palate. In both, the objectives are: 1) map all organizations in Guatemala who work for the same goal to gain a better understanding of current efforts, and 2) facilitate collaboration to strengthen their work and optimize their impact.",,"Descripcion Monto Formación de networks entre organizaciones que están trabajando para un mismo objetivo de desarrollo sostenible. $. 1000 Promover y facilitar la colaboración entre las organizaciones, enfocado en transmisión de conocimientos y lecciones aprendidas.

The demand for our services, as well as the technical and legal support we provide to our community partners, has never been so great, nor have the stakes ever felt so high. &nbsp; Attacks on the immigrant community have included increases in detention and deportation of immigrants; the rescission of DACA; the separation of children from their parents at the border; the mobilization of the military to deter asylum seekers; and attempts to limit the constitutional right of birthright citizenship. In addition, the Trump Administration has overturned established precedent and policies. The Trump Administration is also currently attempting to limit citizenship for low-income immigrants by making it more difficult to obtain a fee waiver for indigent individuals and creating bars to becoming a permanent resident for immigrants who have obtained public benefits. &nbsp; What we do: Welcoming immigrants is still a strong part of our national identity and fabric. We know that when immigrant communities thrive, we all thrive. That’s why NMILC’s legal services aim to amplify the voices and contributions of immigrants and address the historical marginalization of these communities: Legal services to build safety and economic stability in immigrant communities Mentoring legal professionals from historically marginalized communities Connecting clients to community partners and local organizing and advocacy efforts Advocating for policies that support immigrant integration Supporting immigrant entrepreneurs and building assets in the immigrant community &nbsp; How you can join us: In response to the mounting barriers facing immigrant families and workers, we have also experienced an outpouring of support.

And being dependent on your overworked and financially stressed family to take care of you. You may have been this way since you were born. And as you look ahead, you see no way out, no hope for any change. This is the daily plight of tens of thousands of disabled people living in poverty in Guatemala. And this is what we will work to change with YOUR help. To accomplish this, we created the social company&#8211; Escovita. &#8220;The littlebroom&#8221;; Escovita will provide work at fair wages for the disabled, as well as free physio/psychological therap. We will produce and sell brooms made from recycled plastic water bottles. Only disabled people will be hired for the labor-intensive work of manufacturing the brooms. The bottles themselves are given to us for free from restaurants, schools, and other collection points. We&#8217;ve spent over a year testing our brooms&#8211; badgering people to try them out and give us their input. Based on this feedback, we&#8217;ve modified our design eleven times and significantly improved the quality of the brooms. We&#8217;ve also begun some trial sales in local stores in Antigua and are excited to see how quickly they have sold, and how well they&#8217;ve been accepted. Now, we&#8217;re ready for the next step: hiring and training groups of disabled people to manufacture the brooms, making them by hand with the tools and training we provide. It&#8217;s an eight-step process&#8211; one step for each person in a group of eight. We&#8217;ll start with one group, and then, as we learn from that trial and smooth out the process, ramp up to 64 people in this first phase. Please help us get going! With your donation, plus the sales from the brooms that we sell, we will have enough to accomplish this first phase. One of the largest home/hardware chains in Guatemala has already committed to buying all the brooms we produce in this first phase. So, it&#8217;s just a question of getting enough funds to get started. Once past this first phase, the goal is for Esovita to fully sustain itself from the sales of the brooms, while seeking additional funding to scale the company. Our dream is to provide employment for thousands of disabled people throughout the country. (Guatemalahas a population of 15 million, so,there&#8217;ll always be enough demand for the brooms! ) Escovita will also benefit the environment. Ninety-five sixteen-ounce water bottles are used to make one regular-sized broom. These are bottlesthat otherwise would be dumped in land-fills, or accumulate as litter in the streets and countryside. We are also teaching the habit of recycling to the younger generations. For example, we have already nine elementary schools, , with 2500 students, that are collecting for us over 2000 bottles a month. WHY IT MATTERS More than 12% of Guatemalans have some kind of disability, and of those, the great majority live in poverty. They are isolated, often marooned in their family&#8217;s homes, and except for a small fraction of them, receive no support beyond what their families can provide. Most of them are living desperate, miserable lives with almost no hope that their situation will change. By providing people with disabilities work that they can do, at fair wages, as well as free physio/psychological therapy, Escovita will help bring happiness, independence and hope to their lives. HOW WILL THE FUNDS BE USED The funds raised will be used to: &#8212; Purchase the simple equipment need to manufacture the brooms: small-size bottle and wire cutters,ovens, plastic smelters, metal molds and more. &#8212; Pay the disabled for the initial work orders (once started, the broom sales will cover the labor cost) &#8212; Create point of purchase marketing materials to use within the stores &#8212; Provide transport to collect the bottles and deliver them to the stores. As for our own salaries, we are currently working for free. Once the company can afford it, we will beging to pay ourselves a modest salary. Please help us by donating. Even a small amount will help. And just knowing that you&#8217;ve taken an interest in contributing will be a big boost for us We are based in Antigua, Guatemala. We would love to hear from you.

They decided to participate in a course at the Amextra Community Center in Lomas de San Isidro about entrepreneurship, where they learned business basics such as defining a purpose and goals, conducting a market analysis, managing operations, and organizing administration and finances. At the end of the course, they decided to convert the theoretical project they created in class into a real and concrete project. Thus, the “Taste of Dreams” collective, a project for the production and sale of salsas and natural jams, was born. &nbsp; The members of the “Taste of Dreams” collective are young people that are motivated to transform their lives using their talent for entrepreneurship. They have developed creative flavor combinations, such as mango habanero salsa, to cater to a unique market and distinguish their product from the products of their competitors.

These are the ideas of great entrepreneurs! &nbsp; Today, Marco, Angel, Alberto, Flavio, Eric, María del Socorro, and Jaqueline are 100% ready to grow their project.

However, their personal purpose is different: each of them wants to build a better future for themselves and their family. In the area where they live, school dropout and unemployment rates are among the highest in Mexico. Due to the lack of opportunities, many of their schoolmates will see their dreams stifled by becoming involved in addictions, teenage pregnancies or organized crime. &nbsp; To continue supporting the “Taste of Dreams” collective and help these teens reach their goal of a better life, we need to raise $3,000 USD for their materials and additional business training.

Adapt a space to train domestic workers in Mexico to develop job skills that allow them to access better employment conditions. We want domestic work to be recognized and made visible as a professional job that requires specific technical knowledge, skills and abilities. WHY DOES IT MATTER? It matters because our rights are not fully recognized in Mexico. It matters because Mexico is the country with the lowest formalization rate in Latin America in terms of domestic work. It matters because we must organize ourselves to act collectively and demand the labor rights that are recognized to any worker. It matters because 95 of every 100 people who work at home on a paid basis are women. It matters because 1 of every 10 economically active women in the region is a domestic worker. It matters because we want to end inequality that starts at home, because we want to stop being discriminated against, because our work is recognized as any other, because we want to access basic health services, maternity or day care for our children. It matters because we want to be able to buy a house for ourselves or for our families. It matters because we want to save for retirement. It matters because we are people, because we work and because we have rights. CONTEXT Day-to-day domestic workers contribute to the cleanliness, the preparation of food, the care of children, the elderly and pets of the families for whom we work. Our attention, knowledge, dedication and daily effort contribute to the well-being and health of millions of homes in Mexico. However, our work is undervalued and our rights remain invisible, which is aggravated by not having contracts. This leads us to live in very precarious conditions: without access to legal provisions such as social security, day care, paid vacations, bonuses. In addition, many of us live a discrimination and violence within our work environment, from mistreatment, harassment, separation of food or restriction to use certain spaces. When domestic workers do not know our rights or do not know how to defend them, it is easier to reproduce and normalize situations of abuse or exploitation. WHAT WILL WE DO? • Adapt a space dedicated to technical training for the professionalization of housework starting in 2019. • In this space, work skills will be developed to improve the quality of life of domestic workers through the professionalization of employment. The modules include content oriented to knowledge and defense of the rights of domestic workers. How will we use your donation? Your donation will be integrated in a fund destined to: 1. Technical training for domestic workers for the development of labor competencies and for the knowledge of their rights. 2. The adaptation of a specific space to carry out these training activities. 3. Scholarships for domestic workers who are trained. 4. Payment to instructors and promoters to train domestic workers. ABOUT US? The Center for the Support and Training of Domestic Workers (CACEH in Spanish) is an NGO focused on empowering and professionalizing domestic workers.

Mothers and fathers of people with autism face the search of schools in which their children can be &#8220;accepted&#8221; and in many cases without success. The main challenge is that neither the school authorities, nor the teachers, nor the students &#8220;are prepared&#8221; to generate an inclusive environment, an environment of coexistence with differences. In Iluminemos de Azul want to transform the environment, we want more inclusive schools for people living with autistic spectrum and the only way to achieve this is by generating social awareness through school awareness.&nbsp; With your support, we can create a domino effect. We will train mothers and fathers to become &#8220;School Conscientisers&#8221;, we will give them the necessary tools so that they can give awareness-raising talks in schools, informative tools with which they can prepare managers, teachers and students to encourage each time more educational spaces.&nbsp; &nbsp;With your donation we will be able to add wills so that the educational preparation opportunities are the same for people with autism and / or other neuro developmental condition. Whit you support: We can find a suitable place to carry out the training. We will have the appropriate workshops to prepare parents. We will develop support materials to turn the assistants into &#8220;School Conscientisers&#8221; Why it matters: In Mexico 1 of every 115 children has autism, a condition of life that affects social interaction through communication, behavior, language and sensory integration of people. It is a different way of interpreting the words, colors, shapes and sounds of the world around us. Autism does not have evident physical characteristics, which complicates more than people having empathy before attitudes or reactions out of the ordinary, generating a lack of information and therefore of inclusion.&nbsp; Mexico has pending iniciatives with persons with disabilities in general &#8230; the integration of children, adolescents and young people into regular schools is still in process, and private schools with inclusive programs are not available to everyone. We can’t wait for the government to resolve, as a society we must promote and it is the task of parents and civil society to promote educational inclusion and learning. &nbsp; About Us: Iluminemos de Azul is a non-profit organization that seeks social transformation to promote the comprehensive inclusion of people with autism through social awareness and the empowerment of families.

All these peoples are currently in a condition of vulnerability and social inequality. Due to the distances and the elevation of the roads, most of these communities do not have basic services, there is no water, electricity, medical services, schools. Our work is focused on solving the water problem by giving people the possibility of having access to the vital liquid directly in their homes. Because it is important for us: We live in the country of inequality, we have abundance in some areas and lack in many more. Every day we see the migration of thousands of people, abandon their homes in the Sierra to have access to health, education, employment. They do not return to their homes and therefore their customs and languages ​​are gradually lost. It hurts us to see how hundreds of children, women, men and elderly people get sick commonly by consuming water in terrible condition. Our mission is to solve this problem by installing in the homes systems that are environmentally friendly and sustainable. You support: With your support, the gap that separates our initiative and the communities with a need for clean water will be shortening more. With your support you will get the necessary material for the construction of Water Collection Systems. Self-employment will be encouraged and work will be provided to technicians from the beneficiary communities. How will we put your donations in action? With your donation you will directly support the poorest communities of the Sierra Tarahumara, in the state of Chihuahua. It is thanks to the contribution that you give us that we can buy the necessary material for the construction and installation of Rainwater Harvests. Many materials are used for construction; in the graph you can see everything that is needed. In case of not reaching the proposed goal, we will adjust to the budget that you provide us to create only the Rainwater Crop that reaches us. However, we will strive to achieve the goal. Either by this means or by another we will try to help as much as possible. &nbsp; Why it matters: How long can we live without water? Few days. Now imagine an immense group of people who daily struggle to have access to a small portion of water. That is the reality of the Sierra Tarahumara. We have been working continuously for 14 years, which supports us in our work and in our mission. We have all the necessary regulatory documents that our country requires, we can issue tax deductible documents internationally. Our mission is totally coherent and applicable. Potential challenges: We know the risks that we face daily: insecurity, presence of organized crime in the mountain areas. The fear dissipates as soon as we see the benefits and joy in the people who receive the Rainwater Harvests. Currently our message is disseminated through social networks; Several people will be very interested in the project. We would like that if it is your will you will support us with a like in our social networks, in all of us you will find us as a Collection Center for the Tarahuara. About our organization: Since the beginning of the Association, our priority has always been the most marginalized areas of the Sierra Tarahumara; We originally started as a food bank, currently we continue to provide food to shelters, hospitals and schools, a task that complements our work with the installation of Cosechas. From 2006 to date we have installed Water Harvests with which we have provided rarámuris and mestizos in conditions of extreme poverty, a better quality of life. Our work is carried out, mainly, in the municipalities of Guachochi, Guadalupe and Calvo, Carichi, Bocoyna and Urique in the State of Chihuahua.",,"Presupuesto total, detalle de rubros y rubros a financiar por el Fondo de la Iniciativa.

Very little has been written about young Latinas with breast cancer, but we do know that they are often diagnosed at a later stage and with more aggressive cancers that result in a lower survival rate. Guadalupe Breast cancer entered Guadalupe’s life for the first time in 2002. She was 33 and mother to a 3-year old son. A mastectomy and chemotherapy followed. “When the doctor told me I had breast cancer, I was terrified not only for myself, but also for my son. The support I received at Círculo de Vida gave me hope that I could fight this disease. Most importantly, my support counselor helped me find the words to talk to my son.” After several years in remission, Guadalupe had another child in 2010. In 2011 a CT scan revealed cancer had spread to her pelvis. Radiation and chemotherapy followed. Her son was now 12 years old and her daughter 6 months. Then in 2018 cancer returned to her brain, liver, lungs and bones. She had surgery to remove the largest brain tumor followed by radiation. She is now on chemotherapy. Although this is a difficult time for Guadalupe and her family, she fights for her children, and is living life to the fullest. “With the support of my family, friends, and with the tools that Circulo de Vida gives, I have hope that I can once again beat cancer.&#8221; Círculo de Vida Despite the need for psycho-oncology support services, few culturally appropriate resources exist, especially in Spanish, to help Latinas and their families cope with news of the disease, the impact of the illness on their already precarious lives, and a complex medical system. Círculo de Vida addresses these issues by providing support at the time of diagnosis or shortly thereafter, assisting Latinas with understanding the specificity of their diagnosis, helping them get through surgery and treatment, and providing ongoing psychosocial and practical support for the patient and her family. Proceeds Crowdfunding proceeds will be used to support our young mother’s program, as well as, our children and teen program. The program provides individual and in-group support to children and teens, many of them already at risk due to language and socioeconomic barriers, cope with the confusion and stress caused by parental illness.",,"Women&#8217;s Program Executive Director $25,000 Administrative Assistant $10,000 Women&#8217;s Counselors (2, 50%) $40,000 Benefits/Payroll taxes $18,750 Subtotal $93,750 Professional Fees Clinical Director $6,300 Therapist Children (4 ) $25,200 Grant Writer $15,000 Subtotal $46,500 Program Expense Outreach $500 Books &amp; Materials $500 Group Expense $3,600 Transportation $1,000 Subtotal $5,600 Operating Costs Rent/Utilities $15,000 Postage/Duplication $700 Insurance $4,200 Office Supplies $500 Telephone &amp; Fax $1,200 Equipment Repair/Maintenance $350 Computer Expense $1,400 Miscellaneous $700 Subtotal $24,050 Total $169,900",,,ended,,carmenauthorg,

Will you help us? Many mothers awaken daily with the anguish of not knowing if that day they will have a plate of food in their home. In some households they only make one meal a day, which greatly affects the health of the family, especially children who are in the development stage. Not to mention that due to the situation of poverty or extreme poverty in which they find themselves, they rarely include nutritious and varied foods within their menu. This is the case of María Elena, 23, who prepares for her and her three children, beans and tortillas every day: &#8220;Sometimes I would like to give my children something different to eat, maybe milk or chicken, but with $4 a day. What my husband earns is very difficult,&#8221;María Elena said. Just like Elena, there are many other mothers who must choose between food, education, clothing, or make improvements in their home because the income they have is not enough to cover all their needs. &nbsp; What will the project achieve? We are convinced that good nutrition is the basis for the development of children in the country that is why we work to support the most vulnerable families, providing accompaniment and strengthening their skills so that they achieve a better quality of life With &#8220;Change my MENU&#8221; we want to support families so that they have a better diet and thus reduce cases of malnutrition, this through the monthly delivery of food bags that include rice, beans, pasta, cereals, milk, vitamin drinks and soy products. In addition to improving the nutrition of children and their families, we also help improve their economic situation as families receive savings in the purchase of their food which they can use for the education of their children. &nbsp; How can you help? We want to reach more families, for every $ 50 you guarantee an adequate diet for a family! In January 2019 we want to deliver a bag of food to 50 families in the community of Xatinap IV in Santa Cruz del Quiché. With a contribution of $ 50 you will be contributing so that a family of scarce resources has access to a decent diet during a whole month! &nbsp; Why is this important? In Guatemala, 49.8% of children between 3 and 59 months of age show a prevalence of chronic malnutrition (this figure is higher than the average of any other region in the world). 29.1% of pregnant women have anemia, as well as 47.7% of children between 6 and 59 months. A total of one million 272 thousand children are condemned not to reach their physical and intellectual potential. Acute malnourished children total 19 thousand 160, representing 0.7% of children under 5 years of age &nbsp; Please help us, together we can change their menu!

And it is in these contexts that girls, boys, adolescents and young people are formed without many possibilities to break the cycle of poverty in which they live by themselves. &nbsp; WHAT ARE WE DOING ABOUT THE PROBLEM? In Jóvenes Constructores de la Comunidad A.C. We believe in the potential of young people to become agents of change in their communities. Therefore, through our JCC model we provide technical training, training in human development and psychosocial accompaniment for the development of life skills, at the same time that, with the participation of themselves, we carry out construction works of community value ( parks, soccer fields, outdoor gyms, among others). &nbsp; THE OPPORTUNITY In order to benefit more young people living in marginalized communities, we want to take a big step: create the Construction Professions Training Center, a space that will have classrooms, workshops, material equipment and tools necessary for young people to acquire theoretical knowledge and Practices to be certified and access to better job opportunities. We know that our goal is ambitious, and to achieve this we have established various strategies: fundraising events with potential donors, donation in kind from our donor companies and this crowfunding campaign in which your contribution is vital. &nbsp; HOW ARE WE GOING TO USE YOUR DONATION? Your donation and all the money we raise with these strategies will serve not only to complete for the purchase and rehabilitation of the property that is providing us with an accessible price, but also to train at least 60 young people from Colonia Lomas de Santo Domingo and the zone adjoining the Observatory terminals through the JCC model applied in the rehabilitation of the space only in 2019. &nbsp; MORE ABOUT US We are an organization that has more than 10 years of experience training young people, rehabilitating public spaces and transforming community life, recently we were participating in the reconstruction of houses affected by the earthquakes of 2017.

We cannot allow money to stand in the way of this future and be the reason they decide to emigrate. We dream of a Guatemala that provides teenagers and young adults with the conditions they need in order become social leaders who are capable of multiplying their knowledge and experiences in ways that support decision making processes and help others carry out their life goals in the place they were born. According to the National Statistics Institute (INE), in 2015, teenagers and young adults (15-24 years old) represent just over 22% of the total Guatemalan population. Many live in poverty (53% of the total population and 40% are indigenous) and the lack access to healthcare, education, and employment are characteristics shared among many of the country’s communities. It is because of this situation that many young people are forced to migrate in search of alternative ways to guarantee their own survival as well as that of their family and community. &nbsp; For 2019, the LED project’s main goal (LED: Leadership, Education, and Development) is to strengthen the leadership abilities of maya-k’iche’ teenagers and young adults in Totonicapán and Quetzaltenango. Specifically, the project seeks to build personal and collective leadership skills that will contribute to breaking the cycle of migration. &nbsp; Why it matters: Our work involves carrying out a variety of community-level activities based on a training program with teenagers and young adults between 15 and 20 years old; 50% of participants are female and 50% are male. This training incorporates activities designed to strengthen participants’ social leadership skills, specifically their ability to formulate and promote collective initiatives that impact their own lives and those of their community members. In order to participate in this process, our youth participants will be assigned an annual scholarship. &nbsp; By designing and carrying out successful activities with teenagers and young adults, this program also strengthens solidarity, social commitment, and new dreams of constructing prosperous and feasible communities that are possible thanks to their efforts. &nbsp; Scholarship recipients are identified and selected in each community in coordination with local education institutions, local authorities, and community organizations. We consider characteristics such as age, sex, personal trajectory in community service, and willingness to engage in the training process. This willingness is expressed via a letter in which candidates state their personal commitment to the process. &nbsp; Each scholarship includes individual and collective participation in this training process over the course of 12 months. These funds also contribute to funding the community activities that program participants design in training workshops. &nbsp; Each scholarship has a value of $360.00 and every donation -big and small- helps us to work towards our goal. About our organization INCEDES was founded in Guatemala in 2005 by a group of Guatemalan researchers who studied regional migrations and the conditions that caused them. They decided to found INCEDES in order to create an institutional framework that would allow them to advocate for changes in legislation, policies, and local realities associated with migration based on the information their research generated. &nbsp; Our mission is to strengthen society’s ability to address regional migrations as well as formulate and advocate for public and social policies that fully protect the rights of migrants and their families and encourage the right not to migrate. &nbsp; To do this, we have established four lines of work: “Social Vulnerability and Development for the Migrant Family” Program: coordinates and supports processes in Mayan origin and destination communities that promote grass roots efforts to generate conditions that facilitate the right not to migrate. “Applied Research Program”: conducts research on issues related to youth and labor migrations, the relationship between migration, development and human rights, remittances, and immigration legislation “Education Program”: coordinates trainings with government officials and courses with international students and regarding migration and development “Public Advocacy Program”: advocates and advices national and regional executive and legislative bodies on migration issues.",,"Costos de operación Estimación Honorarios tallerista por realización de 3 talleres de formación (estimados para 20 participantes) $ 1,800 Hospedaje, transporte y alimentación tallerista (estimado para 3 talleres de formación) $ 400 Ejecución de Talleres Subtotal Materiales (estimados para 20 participantes) $ 1,350 Alimentación (almuerzos, meriendas, agua, estimada para 21 participantes en 3 talleres de formación) $ 1,600 Reuniones de gestión y coordinación (inicial y cierre) $ 750 Aportación colectivo para desarrollo de actividades comunitarias con los participantes $ 1,300 Total $ 7,200",,,ended,,LED_Guatemala,

Our third program is a back-to-school event, which provides backpacks and school supplies to students attending local Oak Park schools as well as within Sacramento City Unified School District. 2017 was the inaugural year for our back-to-school event and it was a success in exceeding everyone’s expectations! By providing over 200 backpacks to local children, we surpassed our original goal of 150 backpacks. The backpacks contained school supplies for elementary, middle, and high school students. In addition, we partnered with Fresher Sacramento, to provide the students with meal vouchers.

As civil society we are concerned to eradicate this crime from the root, so we took on the task of investigating how it is generated vulnerability that predisposes and conditions the crime of trafficking in persons in its form of sexual exploitation, in this way to be able to understand thoroughly and carry out awareness campaigns that impact society. That is why the campaign against prejudice is important, because we seek to sensitize people, and combat trafficking in persons by reducing factors of vulnerability to reduce the risks of this crime; On the other hand, as training, the material will help to make the operators of the criminal justice system aware of the vulnerability of the victims and be able to prove it as a means of committing the crime, indicating why a victim returns with his traffickers or why not. complaint. Collaboration is essential to eradicate trafficking in persons, APAV AC, has linked with other civil society organizations in order to collaborate with this objective, and potentialize resources, so we intend to disseminate the results of an investigation carried out with victims of Human trafficking who were in a specialized refuge, given that there is very little research with victims of human trafficking, so it is important to spread how vulnerability increases the risks of this crime, in a dynamic way to make it attractive and that permeate in all audiences. Therefore, the goal is to make a material that contains an explanatory and dynamic form for all audiences the results of an investigation in clinical psychology with victims of human trafficking, this material will be a short film made in animation, for which we require donations . The amount of the donations will be used exclusively to pay the cost of the animated video and a small part will be for operating expenses. In case of not reaching the final goal, the resource will be saved until finding other forms of financing for the established objective. The advantage of our campaign is that it is based on identifying the needs of society and therefore we predict that it will have a significant impact. The material that we will be able to use in awareness programs for civil servants and civil society, in order to take action to eradicate this scourge of society, as well as being available on the Internet, will allow people to identify risk factors in the face of human trafficking. preventing them or their loved ones from becoming victims.

The Thomas Fire that struck Ventura and Santa Barbara Counties in December 2017 was the largest fire in California’s history. The wildfire, hazardous air quality, school closures and mudslides led to economic impacts such as destroyed and damaged apartments and homes, lost jobs and wages, increased childcare expenses and other costs for many people across the region. Many people lost needed work especially in agriculture, housekeeping, caregiving, landscaping, and other jobs where immigrants make up the majority of the workforce. But undocumented immigrants are excluded from many federal disaster aid programs, and even when families do qualify for funds, often they are afraid to apply or don&#8217;t know where to go. The 805UndocuFund is a collective effort led by local immigrant rights organizations to raise money and provide disaster assistance to immigrant families in our community. How will the Fund help undocumented immigrants? The Fund will assist individuals and families who have lost their homes, wages, and/or employment due to natural disasters with expenses including but not limited to temporary housing, home repairs, rent, groceries, childcare expenses due to disaster related school closure, essential household items, clean-up items, medical and dental expenses, tools and equipment required for work, school supplies, repair of essential vehicles, moving and storage expenses, legal document replacement and funeral and burial expenses. The 805UndocuFund will also help affected families access other community resources to provide some economic relief. Who is eligible for support from the 805UndocuFund?

I saw women behind desks, teaching, standing in court. You don’t see that where I am from. As a young Latina immigrant, I was always told why was I wasting my time going to school?

We offer an extensive curriculum includes mock interviews, a college applications and essays workshop, financial planning, guest speakers from the clients’ chosen career fields, healthy relationships all while reflecting on the value of believing in your worth no matter what. The fourth session ended with our all Latina girl group remarking on each other’s strengths– things that they didn’t even recognize in themselves. They agreed on how important it was to advocate for themselves and recognized living authentically and being proud of their heritage as immigrant women are truly impressive qualities that could help them stand out and succeed in their future careers. Although the paths they each chose to embark on varied, these young women are united by their tenacity and their desire to serve the community and give back to their new country which has offered them a second chance. Why it matters: We have identified program needs, based on interest from our client community, and now we are in the process of identifying funding possibilities. To be eligible for our services, our clients are living at or below 150% of the poverty line, but that is of course no reflection of their ultimate potential.

We start with a nutritional status evaluation, to be able to detect malnourishment problems and other medical conditions. We will provide the medical treatment, as the case needs it, with a follow up high and weight evaluation, 6 months later. The nutritional follow-up consists in providing breakfast, lunch, and snack, on a daily bases for the ones who study at Libre Infancia, from Monday to Friday; and supplementary feeding with snacks and food bag for those who come during weekdays. Currently, around 500 people are benefited from this program, between parents and their children.

Farmworkers are usually Latin American immigrants or guest workers, who harvest tobacco, sweet potatoes, cucumbers, watermelons, tomatoes, and other crops. Farmworkers have one of the lowest incomes in the United States and face many social and economic challenges. Since 1982, EFwM has worked to respond to the physical, emotional, and spiritual needs of farmworkers and their families, while actively supporting opportunities for them to become self-directive. EFwM offers direct services, and leadership, advocacy, and educational programs that work towards the empowerment of farmworkers, and which are aimed toward a systemic change of agricultural policy at local and state levels. Today, we request your support with interpretation equipment along with books for our mobile library. Campaign summary: Interpretation equipment for 30 people – EFwM strives to have events and programs where all languages are valued equally and where speakers of different languages benefit from listening to and sharing with one other. This is the only way to effectively build bridges between different communities that are inextricably linked, but too often separated by a language barrier. Your donations will purchase 30 receivers and transmitters that will enable seamless communication between English and Spanish speakers during our events and programs. Mobile Library – Thousands of guest workers from other countries travel to North Carolina every year to work in the fields. They can stay in the country for up to 11 months at a time. During this period, they do not have their own transportation and are very isolated. EFwM seeks to provide guest workers with access to a mobile library of 100 books to provide entertainment and comfort during their stay in the United States. The books can be checked out during EFwM’s outreach visits to farmworker camps. We hope to ameliorate feelings of isolation, depression, and loneliness that can occur when far away from home. Your donations will help purchase the books for our mobile library. Why it matters: In our current political climate, immigrants feel isolated, fearful, and rejected by the greater population. They are afraid to speak their own language in public places for fear of discrimination. EFwM believes that everyone should have the right to communicate in their preferred language- without fear. EFwM values language diversity and hopes to create a welcoming atmosphere for all. In order to create social justice together, and break down stereotypes, different groups must be able to communicate, get to know each other, and identify their similarities. We hope that offering interpretation services will help us towards this goal. Our measurements of success will be written evaluations from participants that will be collected after events. Mental health issues have been studied in the farmworker community, and research conducted in North Carolina has found that farmworkers experience substantial anxiety and depressive symptoms. Having access to reading material that interrupts the loneliness and monotony of isolated living can be a therapeutic way to lessen the depressive symptoms that farmworkers experience. Our measurement of success will be recording the frequency of library loans, as well as our conversations with workers about the project, their favorite books, etc. Potential Challenges: A challenge for the language-justice component of our work is that we may need more than 30 receivers during some of our events. A challenge for the Mobile Library would be getting books back in a timely manner since workers’ schedules and locations are often unpredictable. We are hoping to raise $5000 to Purchase interpretation receivers and transmitters (30) Purchase books.

For almost forty years, EHC has been the region’s leading binational environmental health organization. Through organizing, leadership development, and policy advocacy, they work to protect children from toxic exposure and improve health along our shared border. Our local work supports low-income, ethnically diverse communities of Barrio Logan, City Heights, National City, and Colonia Chilpancingo in Tijuana. Approximately 30% of families in our core communities in the U.S. live in poverty compared to 11% countywide. Over 90% are people of color A common thread in all of EHC&#8217;s campaigns is the recognition of the cumulative impacts of environmental, social, political and economic vulnerabilities that affect the quality of life in these core communities. We are committed to working in low-income communities of color to: reduce pollution to protect public health and the environment secure community plans that address low-income residents’ needs reduce toxic air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions improve active transportation and public transit defend children’s health threatened by exposure to toxics increase civic engagement and voter participation About our Project We are requesting support to advance our Climate and Transportation Justice campaign. The following are three of the campaign’s priorities: Advocate alongside community members (primarily women) for a regional transportation plan that prioritizes better infrastructure and increased accessible public transit. Ensure that the equity components of the San Diego and Port of San Diego Climate Action Plans (CAPs) are carried out through the adoption of a Climate Justice Scorecard to establish criteria and benchmarks for energy, air pollution, vehicle miles traveled and greenhouse gas reductions. Educate decision-makers, housing developers, and solar companies about the opportunities for solar investment through effective implementation of AB693, which provides for installation of renewables on low-income multi-family housing. In a nutshell, we have come to discover that the climate justice fight cannot be fought without starting with the communities that are most affected by climate change. And one of the most successful ways to combat climate change and reduce carbon emissions is by providing improved public transportation in our communities.

The program is an opportunity to highlight the importance of women’s leadership, and to accelerate the impact of women leaders through mentoring, networking, training and visibility while they access to their full voice and true power. As they advance in the program they discuss their professional challenges and successes and establish a mentoring relationship in which the seasoned leader guides, advises and supports her peer. Guided and site tours are also available and are received by leading organizations in the city of Miami. The benefits of women’s mentorship are numerous. It establishes camaraderie, creates gender-friendly environments, promotes a stronger environment for women’s success, and expands horizons for further personal growth as you explore innovative leadership strategies.",,"&nbsp; Costs Individual cost (USD) Units Final cost (USD) Program Coordinator &#8211; Staff 1 $20 hour 120 2400 Event Staff 2 &#8211; Internship $10 hour 120 1200 Trainers $200 hour 16 3200 Office Supplies 250 Telephone &amp; Internet fees 100 Online Services 100 Postage &amp; Delivery 70 Branding Material 8 500 Meetings &amp; travels 700 Venue- Refreshments-Coffe Break 15 30 x 6 2700 Equipment 250 Filming &amp; Photography 250 Gifts 15 30 450 Miscellaneous &nbsp; 1500 Total* 12,970",,,ended,,vitalvoicesmia,

Perhaps you wished to be an astronaut, a doctor o a firefighter. Whatever the case, you dreamt about a better future, filled with opportunities. For migrant and refugee children, the future often looks uncertain and scary. Help us change this through the construction of a toy library, where these children will be able to play, learn and reach their full potentials in a safe environment. With your donation, we will build the toy library and fill it with toys, books, costumes and other ludic materials that will allow them to dream and build a better future. Migration is a permanent and growing dynamic, and in the face of an influx of migrants, the US and Mexican government agreed that all of those seeking asylum in the US have to remain in Mexico while their situation is processed. As a result, thousands of people have been left stranded in Northern Mexico, facing a lack of opportunities and other negative consequences. For children and youngsters, the situation is particularly bad, as they face many dangers and situations that risk their rights and wellbeing. Together, let&#8217;s make their stay in Mexico a safe a positive experience, not one marked by fear. How we will use your donations: With your help, we will build and equip a toy library inside a shelter for migrant and refugee children in the city of Tijuana. We will also use the money to provide educational agents and primary caretakers with the tools they need to operate the toy library and promote a safe and violence-free environment for the children. Each toy library is equipped with several kinds of toys (dolls, plushies, toy cars, toy kitchens, etc), costumes, wigs, puppets, books, board games, and other ludic materials specially designed for children. We need your help to make this happen.

Granting scholarships to 100 students allows them the opportunity to receive a comprehensive high school education at the Santiago Institute in Guatemala City.

This is specially true for most of El Salvador&#8217;s public schools. The current sanitary conditions in these schools have extremely negative effects in students and the entire school community: from being exposed to mosquito-borne and intestinal diseases to issues of personal safety and poor hygiene habits.In an effort to promote good water, sanitation and hygiene habits that will prevent disease, improve school assistance and quality of education, tackle gender issues and generate a culture of responsible sustainability; our Rotary Club is committed to working with schools, their communities, and other local stakeholders through its TOILETON (WASH in Schools) Project. WWe plan to renovate the existing sanitary facilities and develop capacities and behavioral hygiene habits among the school&#8217;s students, teachers, parents and community leaders. The project will measure and demonstrate an increased knowledge of WASH practices by the school community and a reduction in school absences caused by diseases related to poor water, sanitation and hygiene practices. During 2018, we successfully completed the TOILETON project in 4 different Salvadoran Schools; and now plan to expand this program to at least 5 more schools during 2019. With your help, we will be able to obtain additional funds from the Rotary Foundation and bring this project to as many schools as possible. The following Monitoring and Evaluation Plan will ensure that each TOILETON project has achieved, that the student population (girls and boys between 6 and 16 years old, including students with disabilities) have access to water and sanitation by: WASH in Schools Goals Providing equitable School access to safe water and sanitation infrastructure with local accepted infrastructure, improved sanitation and hygiene, including Menstrual Hygiene Management (MHM) Strengthening of capacities by school community to develop, fund and maintain sustainable water and sanitation system. To provide sustainable and replicable practices that enhance the school community&#8217;s awareness of the benefits of safe water, and adequate sanitation and hygiene habits. Explain why your project is valuable to your supporters and the world (or the Latino community). TOILETON is a sustainable intervention of safe water and sanitation, which empowers the entire school community from kindergarten to high school on the need to change hygiene habits in a practical way and ensuring the participation of parents, educators and education &#8211; health authorities and community leaders. It also includes the construction of sanitary infrastructure, gray water management, food management from a sustainability approach and the use of low-cost local technologies. The Rotary Maquilishuat Club was founded in 2001 and has implemented hundreds of of development projects and assisting the most vulnerable population all across El Salvador. Between 2016 and 2018 the Club San Salvador Maquilishuat District 4240 has developed three successful WASH projects in schools, in partnership with World Vision El Salvador and with the private sector: Parvularia San Francisco Zapotitán Community School Center in Ciudad Arce. Talnique Educational Complex School. Talnique Municipality. Tres Ceibas School Center. Municipality of Armenia. Challenge: The possible risks of TOILETON are the lack of prioritization and participation of the school community in water and sanitation issues. To this end, a water and sanitation sustainability committee will be formed, which will be trained in hygiene knowledge from a gender and rights approach, maintenance of sanitary facilities and management of local resources and private enterprise for sustainability.

I became impacted by Domestic Violence at a young age when I was most vulnerable and in the process of developing my inner core and beliefs. My life would soon unravel. Who knew Domestic Violence would cast a dark shadow over my life to follow me and dictate the way I felt, the choices I would make and the pain that would be caused because of my distorted view and way of thinking. Domestic Violence and it&#8217;s long term effects of childhood adversities created emotional scars that would get reopened time and time again. As a teen not having knowledge or resources on how to start my recovery and healing process I acted out what was going on inside of me. Inside was anger and much of it. I became destructive and negative and believed that these were the cards that were dealt to me as told by my abuser. I masked my pain and feelings by disassociating myself from others. I became a STATISTIC right along with 1.5 million children who witnessed Domestic Violence each year. Some of you, just as myself will be able to relate to Lisa&#8217;s story in the two minute video. If you grew up witnessing DV you are 74% more likely to commit a violent act against someone. Domestic Violence in childhood is directly correlated with learning difficulties, lower IQ scores, deficiencies in visual motor skills and problems with paying attention. It&#8217;s a vicious cycle that keeps repeating itself until the cycle is broken, exposed, and changed, if not we will continue to have broken and dysfunctional families. Because someone fought for ME, I now fight for teen&#8217;s suffering from the aftermath of this treacherous disease that transcends our Cultura. We are losing our JOVENES to the cycle in addition to Gang Violence, Human Trafficking, and Suicide. JOIN me in the fight. What does what we do matter? “Although there have been inconsistencies and gaps in the literature in regards to whether higher rates of Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) exists among Hispanics after controlling for socioeconomic status, recent studies on health disparities provide evidence that Hispanics are disproportionately affected by IPV (Caetano, Field, Ramisetty-Mikler,&amp;McGrath, 2005;Tjanden&amp;Theonnes, 2000)….Hispanics have also been found to be more vulnerable to the consequences of IPV; for example, Hispanic female victims of IPV are more likely to experience poor mental health outcomes and have suicidal ideation than non-Hispanic female victims (Bonomi, Anderson, Cannon, Slesnick, &amp; Rodriguez, 2009; Krishnan, Hilbert, &amp; Pase, 2001.)” The above-mentioned statistics makes what we do not only important but crucial to the to the development of healthy and well-developed Hispanic women. IPV has ramifications that go beyond the implication of the afore-mentioned quotes. Sacramento and Valley cities are a well-known hub for human trafficking, an epidemic that has plagued our nation. There is a correlation between domestic violence and human trafficking, the domestic violence that is suffered by a woman can be a strong indicator if a woman is susceptible to prostitution. What we do matters!!! Every woman has the right to be safe, a safe and healthy Latina is a healthy Latino community and family structure. What we do ensures that every Latina child, teenager, and adult is educated and given coping skills to identify and remove themselves from an IPV situation. What is the specific goal of our project? Our specific goal is to go into every school in the Sacramento Unified School District, at risk areas, and religious centers and provide educational services to Latinas regarding: Healthy relationships, self-esteem, coping with the aftermath of domestic violence, seeking safety, identifying toxic masculinity, and creating a safe zone for Latinas to grow and develop into healthy and productive woman. All classes will have pre and post evaluations that will include testimonials, data will be evaluated for the effectiveness of reducing violence towards Latinas, evaluations will show growth in the knowledge regarding Intimate Partner Violence and how to develop healthy relationships, Latinas will have gained the resources necessary to identify unhealthy relationships and places that will help them safely distance themselves from unhealthy partners. What will we achieve together? Together we can create a society in which Latina women are empowered by knowledge and resources. Your donations in conjunction with our expertise will help enable us to provide Latinas with the coping skills necessary to develop healthy relationships and building a healthy self-esteem. Because we have partners like you working with us, Latina women will learn to embrace their feminine power by identifying and changing toxic masculine beliefs that have been indoctrinated into them through old fashioned and maladaptive patriarchal acceptance. How much should you donate and what will it be used for? Donations in any amount will be appreciated, our goal is to reach a minimum of $20,000.00. Your donations will allow us to pay for transportation to educate Latinas, pay staff, pay expert guest appearances, pay for software that tracks and reports results, pay administrative costs, pay for materials such as paper, copying, and pens. It will also allow us to maintain our website which will provide quarterly results and testimonials as to the work and progress being achieved. How else can you help? We at TIME OF CHANGE need assistance with Grant Writing, volunteers, Personal testimonials as to the impact of domestic violence (Must provide a Release of Information allowing TIME OF CHANGE to post it on our website or use it in our curriculum), laptop donations, reams of paper, ink cartridges for an HP Printer, i.e., HP950xl and HP951XL.

Conventional kids are also being denied of the opportunity to learn from the differences, grow in patience, tolerance and the value of helping those in need. Inclusion Down 502,fights to change this reality. We offer free workshops for educators of the private and public sector of Guatemala, as well as different media campaigns to educate and create awareness in our society. Workshops for families are also offered to educate and empower parents to fight for their children´s rights. With the support of the Education Ministry we have already reached more than 1,000 educators in three years. There is a lot of work to be done. We need to educate and motivate many more teachers and directors to open their schools to Inclusive Education. We are in the final stretch for biggest event of the year. A workshop for 200 teachers given by an American Inclusive Educator expert, who is also a mother of two Down Syndrome Kids. We are sure that educators will finish this workshop with skills and motivation to start inclusive practices in their schools. Help us multiply our efforts! Diversity is a fact, Inclusion is an act! Everyone knows the benefits of education. All of them apply for people with Down syndrome. After 3 years of work we have reached 1,000 educators of the public and private sector of Guatemala. As well as several parents and close relatives of people with Down Syndrome that are now well informed and empowered. All of our events are free. We have seen more public campaigns that include people with Down Syndrome and 3 schools that have become Inclusive, we will continue measuring the impact of our efforts by the number of schools that become Inclusive. We hope that we will see a future where kids with Down syndrome can choose a school, not an institution that chooses kids by their condition. Other countries in Central America like Costa Rica and El Salvador have achieve this change, we know Guatemala can also be a part of this reality. For our next BIG event, we need $3,000.00 We need to fly our speaker to Guatemala and pay for her hotel, food and transportation for three days, as well as her professional fees. The donations , hopefully , will also cover the rent for the place where the workshop will take place, and the diplomas for the participants.

Their jobs are low-paid, dangerous and isolated. Women wear bandanas to protect themselves from the sun, chemicals and other elements. They also wear bandanas to shield themselves from unwanted sexual attention. &nbsp; Sexual violence against farmworker women by supervisors and co-workers is tragically so common that farmworker women refer to the fields as &#8220;green motels&#8221; and &#8220;fields of panties” and consider this violence to be a term and condition of their employment. &nbsp; Since the #MeToo breakthrough moment, national attention has been focused on sexual harassment, but women living in the shadows are often forgotten. Justice for Migrant Women makes sure that farmworker women are not forgotten and that relationships are created through this art activism project to forge the strong coalitions that are needed to address this problem. &nbsp; The Bandana Project is an art-activism and advocacy campaign that serves as a healing tool for women across the U.S. and in Mexico and Canada. They are able for the first time to speak about their suffering and share their stories with others who also suffer sexual violence. At the same time, they’re able to learn about their legal rights in their jobs and during migration. &nbsp; In 2019, we intend to reach and engage at least 1,000 people across the United States. &nbsp; Donations to this campaign will be used to host Bandana Project events, create a strategic media campaign to highlight how sexual harassment and assault affect farmworker women, distribute educational toolkits with Bandana Project supplies to more than 20 partner organizations to host their own events and awareness activities. This toolkit includes bandanas, an action postcard, know-your-rights-materials, an educational powerpoint for use in events, a social media kit, a sample press release, and other items. &nbsp; We will measure the impact of the campaign by tracking how many events take place, how many farmworker women are reached, how much educational information is distributed, and how many new partnerships are developed. Why It Matters: The first study, conducted in the 1980’s, on sexual harassment against farmworker women found that nine out of 10 farmworker women said that sexual harassment was a major workplace problem. Two decades later, in 2010, farmworker women in California were interviewed and eight out of 10 women said they had suffered sexual harassment in the workplace. Even after those many years of advocacy, it is clear that sexual harassment is a widespread problem that requires ongoing advocacy and devoted resources. &nbsp; The Bandana Project has helped lay a national foundation for building the movement to end workplace sexual violence against farmworker women and other low-paid immigrant women over the last decade. It has proven effective at helping farmworker women come forward about this terrible problem, getting important information into the hands of women who need it, humanizing migrant women, and forging new relationships with partners and policymakers. &nbsp; Funding this year will help us continue to grow the network of allies and advocates who are committed to addressing this problem. &nbsp; Potential Challenges: There has been significant and necessary media attention on sexual harassment and sexual violence work recently, but it has focused on higher paid, more visible workers. People don’t see farmworker women, and it can be a challenge to get the public at large to care about and to become aware of the plight of less visible workers. This requires an additional level of organizing, public education and funds to do the work – especially in the under-resourced farmworker community. &nbsp; The Bandana Project costs will exceed $100,000 over the course of the calendar year. This campaign is aimed at raising the immediate funds needed to purchase the bandanas and distribute the educational kits to project partners. This request is for $25,000. Other Ways People Can Help: People should sign up to share digital content/social media to raise awareness about this Project. They should also encourage their friends and colleagues to contribute to Justice for Migrant Women through the HIPGive social sharing tools. Every single one of us is a necessary partner in ending the widespread sexual violence that farmworker women far too often suffer. Join us in our movement to raise awareness and end workplace sexual violence against farmworker women. &nbsp; About Us: Justice for Migrant Women aims to ensure that all migrant women are guaranteed human and civil rights, including the freedom of mobility, the ability to live and work with dignity- without fear of sexual violence, and the right to be free of threats of violence against them and their families, whether they are migrating across borders, around regions or within states.

The 10 most innovative projects in Mexico will attend a local youth summit of 5 days where we will give tools to enhance their projects as well as boost their personal and collective skills. We seek that young Mexicans willing to generate change, exchange and bond by creating a coordinated youth network. With your donation we will be able to empower 30 teens of the country so they understand that their actions have impact in the Mexican society. How will we put your donations in action? $ 125 USD allows us to pay the transportation by plane of 1 young volunteer $ 100 USD allows us to feed 1 young volunteer for 5 days $ 30 USD allows us to host 1 young volunteer for 3 days $ 15 USD allows us to pay for round transportation by bus of a young volunteer $ 8 USD allows us to pay for a shirt and thermos for 1 young volunteer $ 2.5 USD allows us to give 1 meal to 1 young volunteer Why it matters: The present world is in crisis; the population is constantly exposed to different social problems: climate change, lack of water and food, discrimination and poverty, are problems that are configured as a reality that directly or indirectly affect all humanity. 43.6% of the Mexican population lives in poverty, while extreme poverty affects 7.6%, equivalent to 9.4 million Mexicans. 26% of the Mexican population lacks access to basic services in their houses. In the poorest municipalities of the country, 98% of its population speaks an indigenous language. Finally, it should be noted that in Mexico one third of the total population of the country., 40 million people, are under 18 years of age. Of these, slightly more than half (53.9%) were in poverty in 2014. This means that 1 out of every 2 children and teens in Mexico is poor. That is why CONCAUSA was born. We are at a time where it is key to work with young people because they are one of the greatest generations in history. According to Ban-Ki Moon, &#8220;We can be the first generation to end global poverty and the last generation to prevent the worst consequences of global warming before it is too late&#8221; We also believe that fostering the development of skills and capabilities promotes the participation and youth empowerment preventing educational lag and school dropout. Our goal this year is that 10 teams with innovative ideas, attend a national summit where we will give them the necessary tools to enhance their projects. In addition, we will be working on skills and knowledge that contribute to their personal and collective development. With your donation we seek to create a youth network that manages to solve the challenges of Mexico and the continent by promoting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), a set of global objectives to eradicate poverty, protect the planet and ensure the prosperity of all. Your donation allows us to empower and give voice to teens recognizing their participatory role in our Mexican society. Be part of CONCAUSA! Potential challenges: We firmly believe that teens deserve to be heard and that is why we believe CONCAUSA is the initiative that can make them understand the impact of their actions and decisions in Mexico today. We need the support of all the people who are interested. If you think you can help in another way, do not hesitate to contact us at avillarreal@americasolidaria.org About our organization: America Solidaria is an organization that, since it&#8217;s beginning, has focused on overcoming child poverty, part of its vision being able to contribute to the development of a continent where there are no children living in poverty.

In honor of international women’s month, you can help EBSC support women and girls who have survived sexual violence and gender-based discrimination and are now rebuilding their lives. Please help us transform the lives of immigrant women and girls through legal aid, culturally appropriate counseling, leadership training, and social support. Why our work with women and girls matters: Immigrant women and girls are an especially vulnerable population in the US. The women that EBSC works to support may have faced horrific gender-based trauma such as genital mutilation, enslaved prostitution, rape, and countless other forms of sexual violence. EBSC clients come from countries with little legal protection for women and rampant gender-based discrimination. From working alongside immigrant women, EBSC has learned that many women and girls are afraid of reporting abuse due to the risk of deportation and the threat of sexual violence in their home countries. However, women are less likely to be abused when they are legally and financially independent! Working with women and girls to grant them legal status in the US decreases their chances of deportation or of being killed by their abuser. EBSC provides legal aid for over 325 women fleeing sexual violence and leadership training for hundreds more. Our legal and social programs help women rebuild their lives, support their children, and regain stability in their lives through employment, education, and a sense of community.

On June 15, 2019, the will share their projects with the scientific community in Tuxtla Gutiérrez, Chiapas. Most of this students have to travel long distances to get to the capital city. With the money raised, food, transportation and lodging expenses will be covered. Why it matters: This is the opportunity for the students to show their one year work to scientists and the whole community. This year students have been working in science club, guided by teachers and developing scientific skills. From all the students that wish to work in a scientific area, only 8% of females students and 10% of male students have the skills to access a science career. With these activities were looking to have new scientific vocations and critical thinking. Students get the chance to work and discuss their work with researches. The participation in the Science Fair motivates them to continue developing skills, they get feedback on the projects that helps them improve their projects and this has a positive impact in their communities.

Without minimum attention, these skills and talents may stop being developed, representing a great loss of the country&#8217;s most important &#8220;natural resource&#8221;. PAUTA responds to the need for more young students to develop their skills, with the goal of incorporating them into the scientific community. When talented top students are supported they are able to face great challenges and participate in the resolution of important problems.

In most cases these issues are caused by negative cultural practices such as the sale of girls for arranged and forced marriages, the normalization of sexual abuse an gender inequality.

It serves a population of 6,700 people, who belong to Pokomchí and Queq’chi indigenous people groups. With your donations, you will cover a nurse’s salary for a year. This nurse speaks Pokomchi, Quek’chi, and Spanish. The nurse will be at the health post Mon- Friday, attending to the health needs of the general population. The health post serves 12 communities. Health care for women in fertile ages and pregnant women is given priority. Nurse Responsibilities: Daily health consults at the Health Post Prenatal care once/month Home visits to pregnant women with health complications and new mothers/newborns Twice annual teaching sessions for traditional midwives which will strengthen their knowledge and care of pregnant women Twice annual teaching sessions for pregnant women and their spouses &#8211; topics: responsible parenting, care of women’s reproductive health, family planning, and the creation of emergency birth plans Medical Care during home births Accompany women to the hospital for births as needed when complications arise The health care that is offered is an opportunity to gain confidence amongst the women and promote attendance in the teaching sessions. This will strengthen the husband and wives’ knowledge and influence positive changes in women’s health, and help to stop the pattern of male chauvinism that exists amongst men. This will maintain a rate of zero maternal deaths, increase the use of family planning methods, and improve the sharing of responsibilities between husbands and wives during pregnancies, and promote valuing the work of traditional midwives. The education will not just impact these participants, but future generations as well. Of particular value is that the project serves remote communities, providing care to a vulnerable indigenous population. This services is provided by qualified health professionals, in the population’s mother tongue. Challenge to Address: Lack of maternal/ infant health care in isolated rural areas Isolated rural communities have the highest rate of lack of access to appropriate health care services. This affects the entire population, but poor, uneducated, indigenous women of fertile age are the ones most affected by this. Furthermore, the minimal health care that is provided by the Guatemalan Ministry of Health is often not provided in these women’s language or cultural context, which increases the risk of maternal/infant deaths. Project Importance This project contributes to decreasing maternal death. According to official sources, Alta Verapaz has the 2nd highest maternal death rate in Guatemala. According to the 2000-2018 report on maternal mortality from the public health/ social services ministry, Alta Verapaz had 50 deaths in 2017. From January to March 2018, there were 8 maternal deaths. The rate for maternal mortality in Guatemala in 2017 was 106 deaths per 100,000 births. Since starting the project of providing health care in small health posts in 2007, as described previously, ASOSAP has been able to decrease maternal deaths in the areas where we work. During 11 years, we only have had a total of 4 maternal deaths. In communities where we do not work, they have at least 1 maternal death a year, often more. We are convinced that the integrated health care and education strengthens the knowledge of families and is the key to make changes in their lives, especially in regard to reproductive health. The excellent, culturally sensitive health care that is offered to isolated areas saves lives of women, who are the most vulnerable. Project Objectives Continue providing Integrated Health Care in the health posts – serving 100% of the population with health consults, medication, and education for women and their spouses and midwives Contribute to the use of informed decision making regarding the use of family planning methods, which will continue improving the reproductive health of women Use of Donations As a non-profit organization that has been transparent in our actions since 2004, if the funding goal is not met, the donations will be used in the same project, only with some differences. If we have the following funds: $ 25.00 &#8211; 1 month of nurse transportation (12) $ 50.00 &#8211; 25% of teaching materials for education (4) $ 75.00 &#8211; 25% of medical supplies for health post (4) $ 100.00 &#8211; medication to treat 150 people (45) $ 100.00 – 7 days of a nurse salary (52) $ 350.00 – 50% of the cost of holding a teaching session for midwives, and pregnant women &amp; their spouses (2) Organization Background ASOSAP is a legally established non-profit organization in Guatemala. It is made up of Pokomchí staff who have been the fruit of empowerment, through education and mentoring. Since 2004, ASOSAP has been empowering women who live in remote rural areas that are inhabited by the indigenous Pokomchi population. Through creating partnerships with communities, confidence is gained from the community and health care and education can be offered to them. Through this, women can form their own opinions and make decisions in regard to their reproductive health. This education is done together with the women and their husbands, in order to influence change in the behavior of male chauvinism that is widespread in rural Guatemalan communities. Since 2007, permanent health care has been offered in small health posts that are strategically located in sectors where various communities converge. Consults, medication, home birth care, education for women and men about their responsibilities in regard to women’s reproductive health, malnutrition prevention, and support/education for traditional midwives is provided free of charge. The health care that is offered in these neglected communities is excellent, complete care that is provided within patients’ cultural context as the care is provided by Pokomchí nurses.

Junior Achievement Honduras (JA Honduras) focus to provide entrepreneurship training and financial education to a group of women in the Women&#8217;s National Penitentiary for Social Adaptation, where each of them developed a business idea, presented an investment plan, so we analyzed the viability of each one to be able to distribute to all a percentage so that when they are released they could generate a venture that would allow them to get ahead to them and their family. Our goal is to be able to collect $12.000 which will be invested as seed capital for the 23 ladies in the stage of pre-liberation to which they will be given a capital of $500 and the Social and Labor Reintegration Unit of the Penitentiary Institute will follow-up to their endeavor to ensure the success of the project. Why It Matters This project allows them to give these women a new opportunity and open the doors for them to be agents of change in their community and family. We hope to benefit 115 short-term families and generate at least a minimum wage of L. 9.000 per month. It is valuable because investing in women is the best investment you can make because they first think about their family and then on themselves. The return on investment is higher and economically empowers the community. Why Trust JA? We are a Foundation audited annually by KPMG to transparent the use of the funds obtained.

Along the year, more than 550 Guatemalan children are diagnosed with cancer. About 100 of them will need a Radiotherapy to fight against their disease. Radiotherapy complements the chemotherapy or a surgery; it is specifically prescribed depending on a diagnosis. It is important because it increases the chances of overcoming cancer: it is applied to destroy or stop the growth of cancer cells that are sensitive to radiation. Radiotherapy requires a team of experts and specialized facilities, that are not available in most of the country. About Fundación AYUVI: Fundación Ayúdame a Vivir, AYUVI, is a Guatemalan, private, non-for-profit foundation that provides the resources for the treatment of Guatemalan children with cancer.

Our children and their families live in the community next to the CITY RUBBISH DUMPSTER in zone 3. Their environment is hostile, full of poverty, dirt and surrounded by vice and delinquency which makes them vulnerable to fall in this system. For us at Q&#8217;axal, it is important to introduce our kids to the world of EXPRESSIVE ARTS. We feel that being in contact with any form of art gives them a sense of security, feeds their soul, gives them joy and therefore pushes them to want to improve their environment, their lives; and their future. ART is learning with fun and love. Our goal with this campaign is to get all the necessary equipment and tools to develop skills that have been dormant in our kids due to lack of opportunities. We know that being surrounded by a clean, pleasant and loving environment will make their love for any kind of ART grow. What we need: MIRRORS to cover a long wall in the dance and art area. When kids see themselves in the mirror, they can follow the instructor and also see how they are dancing. It also reflects emotions and that connects them to their inner self. DANCE BARS: In any dance discipline, bars are needed to teach and learn, especially in Tap and Ballet classes. They help dancers with their balance and gives security while learning new steps. SOUND EQUIPMENT: We really need it to set the mood in art classes and also to teach dance and music lessons. Good quality sound makes beautiful music more enjoyable, and all different instruments can be heard and distinguished. BELLS, TAMBOURINES, FLUTES AND ELECTRONIC KEYBOARDS: Along with the guitars, which we already have, these instruments will let us teach them to play music with them so after they learn they can interpret and create music. FRAMES AND ART UTENSILS (brushes of all sizes, easels, paints, sheets, and canvases, play dough, pencils, crayons, markers): These will help the kids to express their feelings through art in a class with all the tools they may need. JUMP ROPES: Jumping rope helps your gross motricity, strengthens muscles and gives energy. And is also fun and can bring children together. HULA HOOPS are a good way to exercise while playing. We want to attack this poor and dangerous society at its root, keeping children away from vices and gangs that are easily within their reach. We are teaching them there are several healthy activities that can keep them busy and away from all these easy addictions. Also, right now, we are giving them a well-balanced diet which nurtures their development and growth. By giving them this different life perspective and lifestyle which they have never experienced, we want them to be the beginning of a chain reaction in the whole community, in which more and more children will be attracted to it just for seeing their example of happiness, education, love and success and hope this passes from generation to generation. Our kids will be NOTICED!!! All of us Q&#8217;axal founders have previously participated in successful projects that are currently working.

She took her 6-month-old son, Sebastian, with her and boarded a bus to Mexico. While traveling through the state of Chiapas, Mexico, Marta was kidnapped and raped. She escaped with a group of migrants and began living in a shelter in Chiapas, but soon discovered that she was pregnant. With a small child and one on the way, she made her way to Mexico City where she contacted the Institute for Women in Migration (el Instituto para las Mujeres en la Migración, AC / IMUMI). IMUMI managed to obtain humanitarian visas for Marta and her son, register the birth of her baby and referred her for ongoing emotional support. The Institute for Women in Migration (IMUMI) provides legal aid in cases such as Marta’s and works to promote and protect the human rights of migrant women and their families. In particular, IMUMI aims to provide protection to those fleeing violence and those that suffer abuses in transit. Many migrant women who have been victims of violent crimes need legal representation in order to request international protection in the U.S. or Mexico. Help us raise funds to continue to be able to provide legal aid for women like Marta. Our financial objective is to raise $5,000 USD to pay for: 1. 30% of the salary of a specialist attorney in Mexican immigration law for one year; 2. Official translations and certification of documents ($1,000); 3. Printing informative material for women in migration and their families ($700) &nbsp; Even if we do not reach our goal, the money collected will pay for the necessary paperwork for migrant women and their families, such as passports, transportation, official translations, document certification etc. Background Information &nbsp; Thousands of women in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras (known as the ‘Northern Triangle of Central America’ or ‘NTCA’) are facing epidemic levels of violence. Gang violence and organized crime is not only widespread, but has intensified, with a devastating impact, especially for women, adolescents, and children. Feminicide rates are the highest in the world, as well as homicides of people under 20 years old.[1] This is the result of both the forced recruitment of children into criminal groups, and the high levels of gender-based and domestic violence. Governmental failure to guarantee their population’s security, as well as the escalation of violence in these countries, have lead to families leaving their homes in great numbers in search of international protection. Since 2014 the number of women migrating with their children has increased. In the past, it was more common for children to be left under the care of other women or family members. Now many mothers travel with their children, as it is the only viable measure that might help protect their children against violence and crime and offer them a brighter future. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) report, Women on the Run, (2015), more than half of the migrant children from the NTCA qualify as refugees and more than 80% of NTCA women interviewed by US asylum officers in 2015 were eligible to apply for asylum, as they demonstrated a credible fear of persecution. In Mexico, the number of asylum seekers and the recognition rate increased significantly between 2013-2016. However, there is still a huge disparity between the number of people granted asylum and the number of NTCA migrants entering the country. In fact, it is estimated that less than 1% of people from the NTCA who enter the country request asylum. And only 0.5% of the NTCA migrants detained in Mexico achieved international protection in 2014 and 2015, and 2.16% in 2016. The rest were deported.[2] Challenges: 1. U.S. and Mexican governments continue to favor the use of military protection of their borders leading to major human rights abuses. 2. In Mexico, the National Institution of Migration (Instituto Nacional de Migración, INM) continues to detain migrants in huge numbers in violation of Migration Law (Ley de Migración) and the General Law for the rights of Children and Adolescents in Mexico (Ley General de Derechos de Niñas, Niños y Adolescentes). 3. Mexican detention centers or migration stations are very closed off, making it very hard for NGO´s and providers of legal aid to contact migrants and inform them of their rights &#8211; the detention centers do not provide the detainees with adequate information on their migration status and their right to seek asylum. 4. As the UNHCR report Women on the Run (2015) demonstrates, Women often take different routes than men in their migration North, meaning they are further from the protection provided by churches or migrant shelters. Sexual favors as payments have become commonplace as part of this journey, and there is a significant threat of gender-based violence. 5. Migrant mothers need to be informed that they can enroll their children in Mexican schools, not only for the child’s educational benefits but also so that mothers of young children can go to work. How we face these challenges: IMUMI legally represents migrant women in Mexico and the United States. Our team of attorneys, who are specialists in Mexican immigration law, US immigration law and family law respectively, process humanitarian visas and carry out the necessary processes to guarantee the rights of migrant women and their families. About our organization IMUMI is a Mexican NGO that promotes the rights of migrant women and their families within the Mexican context: whether they are Mexican women moving to different areas in Mexico, women from other countries in transit through Mexico, or they live in Mexico, the United States or Central America. IMUMI uses an interdisciplinary approach to address issues for migrant women, for example through political advocacy, legal strategy, research, communication and public policy reform. The IMUMI Legal Clinic represents over 200 women and their families each year in processes such as, obtaining humanitarian visas, achieving custody rights and accessing identity documents. IMUMI adopts an individual approach to each case. We aim to provide migrant women with the tools to help them develop their work, emotional and social lives, significantly improving the well-being and security of themselves and their families. &nbsp; [1]ACNUR (2014) Children on the Run, Washington D.C., http://www.unhcr.org/56fc266f4.html [2]El Financiero (2017), “El 0.5% de los migrantes obtuvieron refugio en México en 2015: INAI”, por Anabel Clemente, 11 de enero, http://www.elfinanciero.com.mx/nacional/el-de-losmigrantes-obtuvieron-refugio-en-mexico-en-2015-inai.html &nbsp; &nbsp;",,,,,ended,,imumidf,Mujeres migrantes centroamericanas en tránsito irregular por México from IMUMI on Vimeo.

We don’t! Nobody should! Imagine you are a Human Rights Defender in Guatemala, one of the most dangerous countries in the world for those defending human rights. Your voice represents the dreams of thousands of people in your community. Because of you, they dare to imagine a just, equal and free Guatemala. You wake up in the morning and while taking the first sip of coffee, you receive an anonymous call threatening your life. When you look at your phone, you see hundreds of threatening messages. You shower, eat and while walking out of your house on your way to work, you say goodbye to your family. You hug them with a heavy heart because you know this might be the last time you see them. You go to work filled with hope, but you never return home. A few days later, your family finds your lifeless body with signs of torture. Now imagine an alert system in Guatemala that can save your life. While you receive countless of disturbing threat calls or messages, you can take action against these threats and you can protect yourself. Imagine, a support system that can give you a chance to return home from work without being kidnapped or killed! Every day, human rights defenders in Guatemala come under serious threat. These courageous people deserve our support and must be protected. That is why we have designed an effective tool to help: the Activist Alert. Human Rights under Siege in Guatemala Inequality in Central America is not only visible, it is palpable. You can almost breathe it. Just to stand up for their basic human rights, people have to confront increasingly dictatorial governments. Recent developments clearly show the threats presented by the rise of fundamentalism, closing civic spaces, and the persecution and assassination of human rights and environmental defenders. The rights of women, indigenous communities and human rights defenders in particular are in danger. In several countries, the rule of law has become a thing of the past, and the future doesn’t look much better. Human rights defenders give their all. They risk their lives in the fight to improve the future of the region. Now it is our turn to help them where we can. A well-functioning Alert system is a first step. In 2018, violence against human rights defenders and their work in Guatemala rose sharply in a period of just five months: &#8211; 13 human rights defenders killed &#8211; 135 instances of aggression against human rights defenders reported &#8211; 32 instances of aggression against partners of human rights defenders reported Why does The Activist Alert Matter? The Activist Alert matters because: &#8211; It will give at least a chance to protect those defending human rights. &#8211; It will strengthen and make networks of activists more resilient. &#8211; It will ensure the future of human rights defenders in Guatemala. Our Actions to Create the Alert &#8211; The alert system scans media and the web for signs of danger and provides a place to report threats. -Digital security experts investigate every report immediately. If deemed serious, the activist is warned and preventive measures are taken. -The threat is published and, when possible, legal action will be taken. In neighboring Honduras, the Activist Alert has already proven effective. We designed this through our Nexos Program. Together with our partners, we will design and implement The Activist Alert in Guatemala. How Does the Alert Work? 1. Signaling: The Activist Alert team scans online and offline media for threats and attacks aimed at human rights defenders. Threats are also reported directly by activists themselves. 2. Analyzing: The team’s digital security experts examine each report and estimate how serious and urgent the threat is. 3. Activating: Serious threats are recorded, and the person under threat is warned. If necessary, additional protective measures are taken and legal support is offered. The warning is shared with other human rights organizations and, if safe to do so, published online. Activists who receive a warning feel protected and, more importantly, know they are not on their own. In this way, we give courageous people the support they deserve. How Can you Help? Together with you, we are aiming to make this system available to Guatemala as soon as possible.

This problem is even worse when we talk about the sexuality of a person with a disability because for society, it is almost impossible to think that they can have an active sexual life. The lack of information, education and training in these issues, coupled with the cultural baggage of Mexico, leads to health problems for the population with disabilities and the people around them. The legal position regarding the sexual and reproductive rights of persons with disabilities is contradictory, since, despite being contemplated in several national laws and international treaties, there is no political will to ensure compliance, regulation and financing. It could be said that this issue is non-existent for the authorities of our country and society in general because there is widespread ignorance about their rights. For example, special education schools and public health agencies that serve this population do not include these topics in their plans or work programs. In Mexico women with disabilities outnumbers men (3.8 million against 3.3 million), 6.2% of women in the country live with this condition and in the case of men, they represent 5.7 percent of the total population ( INEGI, 2014). Gender stereotypes have an adverse impact on women with disabilities and place them in a situation of greater vulnerability. For example, the stereotype of motherhood as inherent and natural to women places many of them, with or without disabilities, in the face of the social pressure of being mothers. In the case of women with disabilities, they are not considered capable of complying with this social requirement. In addition, there is a refusal to recognize their sexual and reproductive rights, such as the right to decide whether or not they have children, and even to lead an active sexual life (Torices, 2007). The lack of recognition of these rights restric them from being provided with comprehensive sexuality education, having less or no access to information on contraceptives, sexually transmitted infections, ways to prevent violence, and other issues related to their sexual life and reproductive health, unlike men with disabilities. The problem of discrimination due to disability and gender is compounded by the lack of public policies that address the specific sexuality needs of people with disabilities (Sánchez, 2017). In the field of research and academia, documentation on the subject of sexuality and disability is scarce, a situation that contributes to the poor training of professionals in the area of ​​health and special education. If this lack of information, we add discrimination, social exclusion and denial of parents to the situation of having a child with a disability, the barriers are widened, causing negative effects in their daily lives. The project seeks to offer scholarships to train 30 interested professionals in one year -including women with disabilities- who have the income profile required to complete the Diploma Program on Sexuality and Disability in twelve months, and initiate actions practically immediately, with the population which provide their services daily, from the creation in their work centers of formal education programs and comprehensive counseling on sexuality mainly for women, although not exclusively, because we know that the participation of men in the transformation of discriminatory and transgressive practices of sexual and reproductive rights of women with disabilities, it is essential for the change not only to be a reality, but also to last over time, diminishing the existing gap in sexual and reproductive health services of women with disabilities. the general population in comparison with the population with disabilities. In a period of 12 months the care of approximately 1500 women would be guaranteed monthly, if it is considered that in the Multiple Care Centers as in the Rehabilitation Units, each professional attends an approximate of 50 people monthly. This estimate would allow thinking that each year 18,000 women with disabilities (and men) would be cared for in terms of sexual and reproductive health and, consequently, minimize the factors that interfere in the sexual experiences of people with disabilities. In case of not reaching the final goal, the resources obtained will be used for the delivery of courses and workshops on sexuality aimed at people with disabilities, as well as their families and professionals who provide them with services; within the annual event of GEISHAD, AC, called Encuentro con tu Sexualidad. The number of workshops to be taught would depend on the donation obtained and women with disabilities would be privileged to receive them. The measurement of impact will be made through the periodic evaluation of the achievement of the competencies required to educate people with disabilities fully in sexuality and offer specific counseling. The achievement of this objective will allow each professional in training to account for the number of women served in their workplace and the welfare achieved from this care in their sexual and reproductive health. Interdisciplinary Educational Group on Human Sexuality and Disability Care A.C. (Geishad, AC) works for people with disabilities to demand their sexual and reproductive rights in an informed, free, responsible and healthy manner. Geishad, AC, promotes the culture of disability nationally and internationally, through the creation of a range of academic and professional specializations in this area and above all providing comprehensive care on sexuality to people with all types of disabilities, their families and specialists who provide services to them. The training, counseling, therapeutic and professional care, seeks to give any sexual problems they present. Geishad is a pioneer in scientific research in the area of ​​human sexuality and disability nationally and internationally and has developed courses, teaching materials and multidisciplinary postgraduate studies for specialization in this area. Comprehensive attention to the sexuality of people with disabilities is of the utmost importance, since it is a population with a high incidence of sexually transmitted infections and is an easy target for sexual abuse. For example, among all disabilities, people with hearing disabilities have the highest rate of HIV and are not served by public institutions, considering that they are projects with low social impact. The social and public health cost is high and affects both the population with disabilities and the entire society. The intention of Geishad is to get its methodology to the whole country through the formation of professional cadres in Disability and Sexuality that can achieve a systemic change so that people with disabilities can fully demand their sexual and reproductive rights.",,"Cotización para impartirlo con 30 personas máximo Quotation to impart it with 30 people maximum COSTOS/COSTS Organización / Organization HONORARIOS / FEE $1250.00 (un mil doscientos cincuenta dólares americanos / one thousand two hundred and fifty american dollars) TRANSPORTACIÓN AÉREA Y/O TERRESTRE (INCLUYENDO TAXIS NECESARIOS) / AERIAL AND / OR TERRESTRIAL TRANSPORTATION (INCLUDING TAXES NECESSARY) LOS QUE CON LA LÍNEA AÉREA Y/O EL SERVICIO TERRESTRE SE CONVENGAN / THOSE WHO WITH THE AIRLINE AND / OR THE TERRESTRIAL SERVICE ARE CONVENING DIETAS (D, C y C) /SUBSISTENCE ALLOWANCE (B, M, D) LOS QUE CON EL SERVICIO DE ALIMENTOS SE CONVENGAN / THOSE WHO AGREE WITH THE FOOD SERVICE HOSPEDAJE / LODGING ***** LOS QUE CON EL HOTEL SEDE SE CONVENGAN / THOSE WHO AGREE WITH THE HOTEL SITE RENTA DE SALÓN / SALON RENT LOS QUE CON EL RECINTO SEDE SE CONVENGAN SI FUESE NECESARIO / THOSE WHO WITH THE VENUE ARE CONVENED IF IT WAS NECESSARY Materiales y equipos necesarios CALCULO INVERSIÓN TOTAL / TOTAL INVESTMENT CALCULATION HONORARIOS + TRANSPORTACIÓN+DIETAS+HOSPEDAJE+ MATERIALES Y EQUIPO+RENTA SALÓN / FEES + TRANSPORTATION + DIETS + HOSPEDAJE + MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT + SALON RENT TOTAL $1250.00 (un mil doscientos cincuenta dólares americanos / one thousand two hundred and fifty american dollars) El costo total regular del diplomado por participante es de $1250.00 dolares.The regular total cost of the diploma per participant is $ 1250.00 dollars.Cada taller requiere un facilitador por cada 10 participantes, esto significa que a cada taller o modulo de 20 personas corresponden dos facilitadores como mínimo.Each workshop requires one facilitator for every 10 participants, this means that at least 20 facilitators are responsible for each workshop or module of 20 people.",,,ended,,sexosinlata,

Every year, over 200 children benefit from the education, nutrition and health care services Casa Guatemala provides. Our project is a free boarding school that allows children to live onsite where they receive their education from pre-kinder through grade six; three healthy meals and two snacks a day; and free health care from our onsite clinic Our goal for the Guatemalan Giving Challenge is to raise $5600 for our education program, which is the cost to sponsor a class for a full year. We want our Guatemalan supporters to get involved and be the change they want to see in the world, and in our country! Whether is it $5, $50 or $500, we can all contribute to making this campaign a success! Casa Guatemala knows that by providing these vital services, we are changing the outcome for these children and breaking the cycles of poverty that have kept their families from thriving for generations. Our dedicated staff and volunteers live onsite with the children 24 hours a day. Our trained and certified teachers work in and out of the classroom to provide a hands-on learning experience that prepares our students for continued excellence throughout their educational journey. In rural Guatemala, only 30% of children finish the sixth grade. Over 45% of all children in Guatemala under the age of 5 are chronically malnourished. And from 2009 though 2017 over 30,000 pregnancies where reported in girls aged 10 though 14. These statistics are staggering and need to change. We are making that change. Why it matters: &nbsp; Casa Guatemala has over 40 years of experience in providing education, nutrition and health care to the most vulnerable children in the country. This hard work has resulted in thousands of young people joining the workforce as responsible citizens and loving parents. We measure our impact by the number of children who successfully graduate from our program and continue on to higher levels of education. In the last 5 years, Casa Guatemala has seen 100% of our students continue on to middle school and high school. In a time when we see more and more families fleeing Guatemala due to a lack of opportunity, food or education, Casa Guatemala is providing a safe and secure alternative for families to stay in Guatemala and still be able to provide their children with the tools needed for a brighter future. If we don’t want to see children suffering in cages at the US border, we need to make sure that these families have access to education, nutrition and health care for their children at home, and that is why Casa Guatemala is so important. You can be a part of the solution by donating to our campaign! Potential Challenges: &nbsp; We decided to set the goal of $5600 as that is what it costs to pay one of our teachers for one year. At Casa Guatemala we have 14 full time teachers in our school; 4 teachers who work as house parents to the children who live onsite; as well as our school principal and project director. As you can imagine, the monthly expenses for the education program are the highest and also the most crucial as our work just would not be possible if it wasn’t for the dedicated professionals who teach, inspire and love the children in our care as if they were their very own. We are confident we will reach our goal for this campaign but if we don’t, all of the funds raised will go towards our education program and the salaries of our talented teachers. But we hope to surpass our goal and fund even more of our education program thanks to the #GuatemalanGivingChallenge! We will be rewarding our donors with fun perks which you can read about below! We want you to feel like you are part of our Casa Guatemala family! That you are really making an impact no matter how big or small your donation is! Because you really are! We can’t do any of this without YOU! Your support is what keeps us going and allows the kids in our care to change the world! There are plenty of other ways to help to! Please be sure to share our campaign with your friends and family via email and social media! Tell your contacts why you believe in Casa Guatemala and be our ambassador! You will be amazed how much your donation will inspire others to give too! Challenge your coworkers, family members, friends and loved ones to get involved and help us to grow our Casa Guatemala Family!

The only available way to cook and warm their homes is with firewood. Due to this their kitchens get full of smoke and is the cause of severe cases of pneumonia in children and chronic lung diseases in adults. The smoke in homes is the cause of 5,000 infant deaths per year. Santo Domingo Xenacoj has a population of 8,300 people. 800 of them live in the small village of El Rosario. Each child growing in this village walks an average of 3 kilometers a day to be able to attend their school and our Early Childhood Program at Escuela Rural Mixta El Rosario –reason we have learned about this problem in detail. El Rosario school was inaugurated in 2003 with 23 students, 2 classrooms, 3 teachers and one improvised kitchen made of metal-tin roof, cement blocks, and the good will of the fathers of each family. The meals to be cooked daily are the proud work of the community. Children bring once a week 4 logs of firewood to prepare the food at school for a week, mothers are the creators of the weekly menu, fathers contribute with the weekly cleaning, and teachers distribute the scarce resources that they are able to gather. More than 8 years ago a donation was received so that with the help of the parents, a kitchen would be build with a good foundation, cement walls, and a roof that would not leak rain through it. Unfortunately, important things like natural light, ventilation, hygiene, and care for health were not considered in their plan. For this reason, smoke is in the kitchen every single day. Without proper air flow, irritated eyes, dry coughing, and headaches are part of the daily routine of mothers that cook the meal of the day for the children. The school now has 77 children and mothers take turns to cook for approximately 3 hours each day to feed the school children. This kitchen is toxic, the roof is not sealed properly, and rain comes in. Also, mice can squeeze in and visit early in the morning, the shelves are deteriorating, and their washing station “pila” makes miracles to wash 5 big pots, 77 plates, and 77 cups each day. 54% of the mothers suffer from pulmonary diseases and 38% has conjunctivitis or pink eye. School absences are regular due to 74% of the students having respiratory issues. What is needed for a change? Replace the open fire with an improved safe kitchen and build a working chimney that lets smoke out. With an optimized stove to cook firewood will last longer and will free all mothers and children from any risks associated with the smoke and open fire. It is more than a simple remodeling of the kitchen, it goes beyond: improved quality of life, hygiene, public health, women empowerment, education, and environmental consciousness. With this remodeling, children and mothers will have a better environment; full of happy stories, adequate nutrition, clean air, and the smoke would not be part anymore of their daily routines. Idea Global is a group of Guatemalans that since 2014 serves in 15 communities with 201 children and 163 mothers promoting a program in early stimulation, nutrition, and emotional well-being. With the hard work and commitment we have been working in eliminating anemia, malnutrition, and improving cognitive development in 94% of our communities. In this way, we are moving towards an optimal growth and development of the children of Guatemala. Together we can help a special school like El Rosario turn around the future of their community. For every “click” you make, for every “share” you do, for every donation you give, you are contributing to the remodeling of the kitchen of their dreams – a space free of smoke and filled with hope. With every little bit raised we will be able to provide an ecological stove, a refrigerator, proper shelving, pots, kitchen utensils, plates, cups, and a clean table for them to eat with a view of their beautiful community.",,"Cantidad Descripción de las necesidades Total Q Total $ 2 Ventanas con sus vidrios nevados Q 950.00 $ 119.00 2 Balcones de hierro redondo Q 1,900.00 $ 238.00 Chimenea de 10&#8243;Pulgadas y sombrero chino Q 1,950.00 $ 244.00 Instalación de chimenea con sus soportes Q 500.00 $ 63.00 Plancha de hierro fundido de 90cms Q 7,500.00 $ 940.00 Mano de obra para fabricar sifon de humo, reparación de la base y fundir plancha Q 1,100.00 $ 138.00 Azulejos para remodelación de cocina Q 2,000.00 $ 250.00 Materiales para remodelación de plancha (ladrillos, cemento, horcalza, talpelate, azulejos para horno) Q 750.00 $ 94.00 Refrigeradora de 2 puertas Q 12,300.00 $ 1,538.00 Comedor Q 6,200.00 $ 775.00 Mesas y sillas para comedor en el jardín Q 3,500.00 $ 438.00 1 Armario para cocina Q 2,000.00 $ 250.00 3 Estantería de metal Q 3,000.00 $ 375.00 Artículos para la cocina Q 1,500.00 $ 188.00 Otros gastos (desengrasante, lija para madera, cepillos, pintura) Q 1,350.00 $ 170.00 Total Q 46,500.00 $ 5,820.00",,,ended,,,

With the construction of this community soup kitchen, we hope to create and train a network of women from the community Prados 3rd section, to provide food security to the elderly, people in conditions of poverty and to those who are marginalized in their community with the objective of reducing violence in their community. &nbsp; Why does this matter? Violence against women is a phenomenon that has increased in recent years in San Luis Potosí and in Mexico, it is important to prevent and address the problem by addressing its origins. We want to include the participation of the community to improve coexistence and develop resilience and empowerment in the population. &nbsp; Context Since 2017, San Luis Potosí has positioned itself on the list of the 100 municipalities with the highest number of femicides and sexual violence against women. This is why on June 21 of that same year, an Alert on Gender Violence against Women was declared. To the east of the City of San Luis Potosí the neighborhoods Prados 2nd and 3rd section, El Palmar, Cecilia Ocelli, Azteca and Ciudad 2000, are just some of the neighborhoods with the highest degree of marginalization and poverty, which coincides with the areas greater incidence in delinquency and violence against women. Overcrowding, precariousness, lack of opportunities, are some of the conditions that lead the population to participate in illicit activities as an alternative for subsistence. The population of youth that participates in gangs are not only marginalized by the structures of the government, but by the population that sees youth as a potential threat. One of the most prevalent crimes in the aforementioned neighborhoods is robbery (residential break-ins and muggings), with women being the main victims. The foregoing led us to analyze the origins of crime, coming to the conclusion that these crimes are related to poverty and addictions; that is, people who commit robberies do so to obtain an economic resource that they use to buy inhaling drugs (glue, solvents, etc.), which they consume in order to mitigate hunger. &nbsp; &#8220;Solvents disinhibit you, make you forget. They take away the cold, the hunger and it is very economical. Based on drugs, one survives emotionally to an indigence full of aggressions, violence and neglect.&#8221; &nbsp; What will we achieve? With the construction of the community dining room in the neighborhood Prados 3rd section, we will be able to provide food security for people in conditions of indigence, marginalization and poverty. Not only those who are prone to commit crimes because of hunger, but also the elderly who do not have sufficient income to satisfy their basic needs. With the construction of the community dining room in the neighborhood Prados 3rd section, we will be able to provide food security for people in conditions of indigence, marginalization and poverty. Not only those who are prone to commit crimes because of hunger, but also the elderly who do not have sufficient income to satisfy their basic needs. The cafeteria will promote social cohesion in the community, benefiting more than 6 neighborhoods and serving as a strategy to prevent violence and delinquency in the community as a unique approach to reduce drug consumption and consequently violence and crime in the community. Note: The dining room will be built in a community space that has sufficient area and has been authorized for use in the project. &nbsp; What amount do we need and what will it be used for? The goal is to raise at least 4,200.00 USD (approximately 84,000.00 MXN) to acquire enough equipment and furniture to create the community dining room that has the capability of serving 300 people daily at the least.

You wake up at the crack of dawn to the cries of the roosters. You shower, eat, and head to school. Your school may not have enough chairs for each student so you stand or share. You also don&#8217;t have any textbooks, so you must write down everything the teacher says into your notebook. You want to salir adelante but how do you start when you don&#8217;t know how to read? How do you begin to learn to read if you&#8217;ve never touched a children&#8217;s book, looked at its pictures, imagined a world outside of your own, or had anyone to read to you? Young children who were not yet in school were unable to access age appropriate programming, period. Responding to the expressed needs of the local communities, CREA&#8217;s Library Services staff created Mommy and Me. Starting with 4 women and their young children, Mommy and Me has grown to welcome over 50 women and the youngest of learners. Each Wednesday afternoon, women with babies, toddlers, and young kids travel to CREA for enrichment programming that includes song, movement, stories, art, and book-lending. Why does this project matter? Young children in rural Nicaragua have no access to books and materials The project makes sure the youngest of learners have the opportunity to be in comprehensive learning program designed to prepare them for success in school The project also focuses on mothers, many of whom have very little formal education, in providing them and their children a caring learning environment. What are we going to do specifically in this project? Provide reliable transportation in rural Nicaragua so mothers and their young children can attend on a weekly basis despite sun, dust, and sometimes torrential rain and strong wind Critical materials to create dynamic and fun programs geared to women and their children Salary support for the incredible Library Services staff that creates a learning environment for all participants What will achieve with your support? Children will be introduced to reading at the key ages for 6 months to 5 years of age to become life long learners How are we going to invest the gifts for this project? $940 USD will be utilized to support the salaries of the two Library Services staff members that make Mommy and Me a reality each week $1560 USD will be utilized to provide safe and reliable transportation for an entire year for women and their young children to attend CREA each Wednesday afternoon from multiple rural communities $500 USD will be utilized to purchase supplies such as crayons, colored paper, markers, play-doh, and more, as well as healthy snacks for participants Who are we, CREA? CREA, founded in 2015, inspires rural Nicaraguans through literacy and education. Since its inception, CREA has been actively working with children and youth in primary and secondary school through its Library Services, Youth Development, and Education Outreach Initiatives.

After they experience a type of sexual abuse or violence they have no place to go for proper care. For the Red Cross Saltillo it is important to be part of the attention to these women who have been victims of such violence. Women in Mexico of any age should have the attention, support and tools necessary to attend after living a traumatic situation in their life. The objective is to create a Saltillo Red Cross specialized in gynecology to care for women who have been victims of sexual violence. Here, a specialist, may offer the necessary check, free medication if necessary, and any additional psychological or medical attention you would need, at no cost. How will we put your donations in action? The donations will cover what is necessary to acquire an ultrasound machine, necessary gynecological tools, as well as to adapt the physical space to start giving this attention. If the goal is not reached, it will continue with the same focus of the project, we would only remove the machinery that is more of a luxury. The resources will be focused on adapting the necessary space to be able to give attention. Being part of the answer to the question of many women after a situation of sexual violence, &#8220;Now what will I do?&#8221; It is one of the most satisfying things we can do. There are places that provide psychological and moral support to victims, but not many that offer physical support for themselves. Why it matters: The impact that this project would have in Saltillo is innumerable. Up to date our contact with women is constant, receiving a minimum of 300 women in our facilities per day. Listening to their stories and being part of the solution is our main goal. A victim of violence should never re-victimize. That is why with this project, all our staff will be trained to provide the women who come, the best possible care. It is not only important to re-educate our men and that women no longer have to live as victims, but also to give them the attention and resources necessary to move forward. The Red Cross is a name we all know. We exist with the only value of giving our all for the most vulnerable citizens. Our goal with this project is focused on that. Potential challenges: Our needs always go beyond just this project. We are the only delegations in Mexico that still provides our services 100% free.

Imponentes cascadas y paisajes extraordinarios, un clima adorable y grandes recursos naturales. Sin embargo, debido a la complejidad del terreno compuesto por grandes montañas, no todas las comunidades de la región tienen acceso a agua entubada y sistemas de drenaje y saneamiento. La lejanía de las comunidades y lo dispersas que se encuentran sus casas, convierten en una posibilidad muy distante la introducción de sistemas de agua, por ser de difícil instalación y muy costosa. Esto provoca que el abastecimiento de agua para las necesidades básicas de una familia tenga que provenir de ríos o pozos, generalmente a gran distancia, niñas y niños muchas veces tienen que hacerse cargo de esta tarea. Uno de los proyectos que me enamoró de World Vision y que además me motivó a ser su Consejera para San Luis Potosí, es justamente WASH, que promueve procesos de transformación social mediante el fortalecimiento y desarrollo de habilidades en temas de agua, saneamiento e higiene. Dentro de WASH se tiene la línea de construcción de tanques de captación y cosecha de agua de lluvia, que aprovechan este recurso que es muy vasto en la zona, y ayudan a que las familias tengan acceso a agua mucho más segura y de manera más cómoda. Me impactó mucho la forma en la que la organización trabaja para empodera a las personas de una comunidad para ser su propio factor de transformación. Se les capacita no sólo en la construcción de los tanques, sino en el uso y aprovechamiento del agua, el mantenimiento del tanque y en la adopción de hábitos saludables. Mi objetivo es recaudar lo suficiente con su ayuda, y poder financiar la construcción de un tanque de captación de lluvia en una escuela del municipio de Matlapa. Se verán beneficiadas más de 100 niñas y niños por ciclo escolar. Lo interesante es que estos tanques tienen un tiempo de vida que supera los 25 años. Para el financiamiento de este tanque, estoy buscando recaudar $20,000. Este recurso permitirá a World Vision México capacitar a los maestros y padres de familia de la escuela en la construcción y cuidado del tanque, se capacitará a las niñas y niños en temas de cuidado del agua y en la adopción de hábitos saludables. De igual manera esta cantidad también permite cubrir el costo de los materiales y su monitoreo por parte de la organización. Espero contar con tu apoyo. Si la meta no fuera alcanzada, lo recaudado se dará al fondo general de WASH de World Vision para apoyar con una parte de los recursos de otro tanque. Esta es una plataforma segura y tus donaciones se manejarán de forma transparente. La construcción de tanques de captación de lluvia ayuda a las familias a tener acceso a agua segura y de una forma mucho más cómoda, es un proyecto valioso porque es sustentable y mejora las condiciones de vida de las comunidades, además de cuidar y aprovechar los recursos naturales. Creo en este proyecto, y busco tu apoyo. a lo largo de mi vida siempre me ha gustado sumarme a causas que promuevan transformaciones en el mundo y es por eso que creo en World Vision. World Vision México es una organización reconocida por su transparencia y efectividad de programas.

Educated girls become intelligent, strong women who lead in their communities. The Mariposas’ scholarship program provides assistance for young women from six marginalized communities in the states of Puebla and Tlaxcala, Mexico to attend a university, giving them and their families an opportunity for a better future. Mariposas’ scholarship recipients are selected from a talented pool of applicants that are from one of the six rural communities we work in. All have participated in Camp Mariposas and the majority of the scholarship recipients have also participated in our other two empowerment and leadership programs: Club Mariposas and Environmental Service Adventures. Camp Mariposas, the first step to becoming a Mariposas, is our week-long annual leadership and empowerment camp that focuses on improving self-confidence and developing solutions to the obstacles faced by girls every day. Camp sessions include: goal setting, healthy relationships, reproductive health, team building and leadership. We aim to self-empower them to understand and realize that they are capable of reaching their full potential and achieving their goals. After the Camp most of the Mariposas want to further their education, but do not have sufficient financial resources to do so thus our scholarship program was born in order to support these girls in achieving their dreams. To date we have proudly provided 17 college scholarships! Each college scholarship is $1,600/ year for four years, which supports their room, tuition, and board. Each recipient is required to maintain a 7 out of 10 GPA and to give back to their community by volunteering at least 70 hours a year. A great example is Bere, one of our first college scholarship recipients, who graduated in 2017 from BUAP (Mexican state university in Puebla) with a degree in Business Administration. In 2016, as part of her volunteer requirement she actively participated in the Environmental Adventure Program as a mentor and helped organize several projects back in her community. But don’t take our word for it, hear from Bere herself about the impact that your donation has had on her educational opportunities: bit.ly/BereMariposas Every girl deserves the right to an education, but even if they have access to it other barriers can prevent them from graduating high school. Nationally, Mexican women face major social and health challenges due to the high prevalence of teenage pregnancy. Teenage pregnancy increases the probability of dropping out of school, living in poverty, having low-income jobs, and the risk of maternal death. Mariposas finds that by increasing educational opportunities and engaging young women to identify and achieve their goals/dreams we can help them graduate high school. An inadequate educational system, a lower value placed on educating girls, and the gender-based disparities that exist in Mexico contribute to the fact that women face a lack of programs and resources focusing on leadership, education, and professional skills. One of the key ways young girls can avoid teenage pregnancy is through access to continued education. Educating young women does not only have a positive impact on the individual, but for every extra year of primary school it can boost a girl’s future wage from 10 to 20 percent and an extra year of secondary school increases that earning potential by 15 to 25 percent. Specifically, according to the World Bank, increasing the share of women with a secondary education by 1 percent boosts annual per capita income growth of a Country by 0.3 percentage points. Beyond boosting a country’s economy, increasing a women’s wage can help provide economic security and independence allowing a woman to have more control of her life. Mariposas is creating a ripple effect. In 2018, we conducted an impact survey across all of our participants and found 100% of Mariposas who participated in all three of our programs, the Camp, Environmental Service Adventures, and Club Mariposas, have graduated from high school. To read more about how Mariposas empowers young women to follow their dreams and focus on their education read our full impact report here: bit.ly/MariposasRipple &nbsp; &nbsp; Empower Mariposas for International Women’s day! Our goal is to raise at least $4,800 USD through the HIPGive platform to continue to provide the opportunity for young women to reach their full potential and follow their dreams through our scholarship program and our other Mariposas educational and empowerment programs: Camp Mariposas and Environmental Service Adventures. Your financial support is critical to expanding the amount of opportunities we can offer to the young Mariposas which inspire them to graduate and enhance their communities. 100% of donations will go directly to empower young women.

In addition, 80% of deliveries happened in their homes. This may cause such deaths, whether due to infection, asphyxia or prematurity. The inequality gap in health is very big in our country. Our goal is that there are no more preventable deaths of mothers or newborn in our country. For that, we have created a program of Community Health Workers (CHW), chosen by their own community and people, empowered with a tablet app. More than 10 cluster-RCT in Africa and Asia showed that home visits by CHW can reduce neonatal mortality. For this reason, we will use the good mobile coverage and existing network in the communities in the amazon to monitor the pregnant women of each community through our app. The implementation and constant supervision will be the success of our program. In order to meet these requirements, we must cover a cost of USD3500 per community. For now, we are working in 80 communities of more than 2400 that exist only in the jungle of Peru. We want to expand our program and you can help us avoid these maternal and newborn deaths. How will we put your donations in action? 1. We will use the USD3500 to implement a community with the following materials: Induction training in technologies to the CHW and good practices in the delivery to midwives and CHW. Feedback and update training. Institutional uniform for CHW and midwives: four (4) t shirts, one (1) vest, one (1) tablet Printed material: Emergency Delivery Plan, Homebirth preparation card, Immediate care of the newborn card, General care of the newborn card, Poster of warning signs during pregnancy, Poster of warning signs during childbirth, Poster of warning signs after childbirth and Poster of warning signs of the newborn. Monthly supervision. 2. Our desire is to be able to work in 4 more native communities in Loreto. In case we do not reach the goal, your donations will help us to keep the communities we work with. 3. In each community with which we work, there are at least 4 pregnant mothers. With your donations, we can teach them what is necessary through our app and our community health workers to save their lives. Why it matters: We will be able to save the lives of many women who don&#8217;t know what the warning signs are during their pregnancy and their newborn children. We will know that we are impacting them because we will have their registration in our application, and we will continue to monitor them until a week after their baby is born. In this way we will reduce the giant health gap that exists in the Peruvian Amazon, and we will reduce the maternal and newborn mortality that is so high in our country. Our working method has been tested in Africa and Asia. In addition, we developed a pilot in 2015 where we obtained great results: we managed to increase institutional deliveries by 21% (from 16% we passed to 37%) which reduces the probability of maternal death; we managed to increase prenatal control by 25% during the first trimester (from 38% to 63%), which increases the chances of institutional delivery; and finally, we managed to increase the ID of newborns by 28% (from 2% to 30%), which provides better health opportunities for the baby. All this work allowed us to win two grants: Grand Challenges Canada and the national fund of CONCYTEC. Thanks to them, we have been able to begin our work with the 80 communities where we are currently present. We have many more communities to go to.

We all dream of a better Guatemala in which there are real opportunities that foster economic and social development so as to provide security, peace, and well-being… But, how can we achieve this if we do not even have access to high-quality education? Since 1963, Fundación Junkabal has focused on offering this opportunity to Guatemalan women. Even though, both, men and women must be educated; it&#8217;s become imperative to prioritize our support to women whose role in society has been minimized, mostly due to cultural reasons. The world needs a strong and well-educated female that are able to achieve work-family balance and, therefore; become authentic change agents in society. For more than 50 years Fundación Junkabal has provided Guatemalan women technical training in several areas. In 1971 it opened Colegio Junkabal and, nowadays, it is able to serve more than 525 students. The school is located in zone 3, just a few blocks from the city&#8217;s garbage dump, an area inhabited by needy families. Through many fundraising activities, Fundación Junkabal is able to provide a large amount of partial and full scholarships to students from this and other parts of the city. AFTER SO MANY YEAR OF EXPERIENCE, THE TIME TO DREAM BIGGER HAS ARRIVED! The need for more infrastructure capacity has become evident because of the increase in the number of admission requests as well as of the growth in demand for more technical training programs. In order to continue our work and to provide integral education to a greater number of girls in Guatemala, the construction of new and high-quality infrastructure is a must. The current building has reached its maximum capacity and the classrooms that house the little ones (kindergarten, first and second graders) are dilapidated. We dream of being able to build a new school that has 30 classrooms, a library, a cafeteria, a recreational room, and sports courts. The project will have to be carried out in 4 phases. The first phase has a cost of $ 600,000.00. LET&#8217;S BUILD THE FIRST CLASSROOM TOGETHER! Through this platform, we encourage you to join us in the construction of the first classroom. To make this dream come true, we need to raise $ 10,000.

The simple act of giving a kid a pencil can also lead to a string of unexpected and wonderful consequences. With a pencil a child can take notes in class, complete homework, and draw beautiful pictures or lazy doodles. In Guatemala, many children do not have access to even the most basic school supplies. Although education is free in Guatemala through the sixth grade, before the start of school each year children receive a list of supplies they need in order to participate in class. Purchasing school supplies, even a box of pencils, is an enormous investment, especially in the department of Sololá where many families live on less than $2.00 / day. Sololá is a department located in the southwestern region of Guatemala. It is very well-known for its cultural heritage and for being home to Lake Atitlán, considered one of the most beautiful lakes in the world. Unfortunately, Sololá is also known for a high rate of impoverished children and a high rate of school drop-outs. Hogar de Niños Fátima, is a model home for children that provides holistic care. The headquarters are located in Guatemala City and an expansion project is planned for Sololá. With our campaign, “If you give a kid a pencil” we are hoping to transform the Sololá location into the base for a network that helps children within their communities to increase health measures and reduce school dropout rates. *If you don&#8217;t remember, we recommend reading If You Give a Mouse a Cookie, by Laura Numeroff. Why does it matter? In the Southwestern region of the country eight out of every ten children abandon their education in elementary school in order to work or to migrate exposing themselves to exploitation and losing the opportunity to study during their childhood. With your help we can encourage our children to complete their education and develop their communities. If you provide a child with a pencil, you give them a chance to study. A child who can complete their education and graduate has better job opportunities. Better job opportunities reduce the need to migrate. When a child can stay in their home, the talent and skills they bring help to develop the town. A developing town attracts more support, and better teachers who can continue to support the next generation and keep the cycle going. How can you help? Our goal for this summer is to raise enough money to provide school supplies to all 300 children in elementary school and high school in the town where Hogar de Niños Fátima’s new home will be located. In July every donation of $10.00 helps to sponsor a child and allows her to complete her education and gives her the option to remain in her community. $10.00 provides a child with notebooks, pencils, erasers, and glue. If we pass our goal we will choose another school to support and bring school supplies to more children. Join us and share in our mission. Your support is vital to achieving our goal and if you know more people who can help us achieve our goal, share our project and follow us on social media. What does Hogar de Niños Fátima do? Hogar de Niños Fátima (Fátima’s Children’s Home) was founded in 2002 and for over sixteen years we have provided a home to some of Guatemala’s most vulnerable infants and children. The children in our care have been abused or abandoned or are victims of family disintegration. Our primary mission is to provide our children with love and support in a family setting. We provide shelter, health care, education, nutrition, legal assistance, and psychological support to the children in our care. We have space for 45 children and although we only accept new placements up to the age of 7, if a child has already been placed with us and continues to need a place to live, they remain part of our family until the court or the child decides to leave. Our home is built and staffed to provide children of all ages with high levels of specialized care and attention. Many of the children we receive are malnourished and have suffered physical abuse and psychological trauma. We provide all our children with basic necessities, pediatric care, psychological support, and the love of a family. All of our children who are of school age attend local schools and receive additional instruction at the Home from our full-time teacher. During the school day the teacher helps plan and run activities for the pre-school age children and in the afternoon works as a tutor for the older children. In addition to providing a loving home for the children in our care, we have begun to expand our services to reach vulnerable children while they are still living with their families. We provide basic food baskets and school supplies to help support children and their education.

Why it matters: “I plant for Tonanzi” consists of an initiative of Partners El Salvador that began in 2018, with an ecological restoration project to infiltrate water into the aquifers. Tonanzi means in the Nahuat language of our ancestors &#8220;Mother Earth&#8221;. With the 2018 project, we began the restoration of the first area of the municipality of Tecoluca, San Vicente, intervening 21,000 m2 of degraded land and in which 700 native trees were planted. The scientific technique and the commitment on the part of the communities, the local government, and Partners El Salvador has until now managed to conserve the area and the growth of the trees that will fulfill the ecological function of infiltrating water into the aquifers for greater availability of the resource in the communities of Tecoluca. Potential Challenges: To start up the I Plant for Tonanzi project, we will need $550, with this amount we can make possible our execution plan: 1. Cleaning of the intervention area 2. Workshop of environmental education with the community. 3. Working Day of reforestation of 400 trees. 4. Maintenance actions such as cut undergrowth and use of green fertilizers. This is what we expect to achieve with your help: 1. Clean the area of 7,000 m2 for adequate growth of the forest. 2. Carry out a reforestation day for the planting of 400 trees with the participation of 50 people from Tecoluca and San Salvador. 3. The purchase of green fertilizers that allows maintaining the humidity during the summer of the trees. 4. The transport of trees. 5. Maintain during the winter for the 7,000 m2 of land that would ensure another year of sustainability to the forest. In case of not achieving our goal, the funds raised will go to maintenance of the protected natural area.

March also begins the cold seasons of the year and it is common for us to see that in winter authorities announce the opening of temporary shelters to prevent people living on the street from dying of hypothermia. &nbsp; The situation of vulnerability and the violation of rights is unquestionable, however, the winter season eventually ends and the common people again forget these people who are in our environment every day, but that we do not see except in these months especially dangerous for them. &nbsp; Since 1994, &#8220;Gente de la Calle&#8221; Foundation has been promoting the definitive eradication of the street situation in Chile. It is a proposal that calls on different agents and public and private institutions to implement and consolidate a network of protection, promotion and institutional protection for people in street situations, with special emphasis on the most vulnerable, such as older women, every time that legal norms and international conventions that enable the establishment of legitimate mechanisms to achieve compliance and impose, if necessary, their restoration. &nbsp; WE CAN NOT HAVE ELDER WOMEN IN STREET SITUATION! &nbsp; In the absence of public policies that address the violations of rights suffered by older women living on the street, we seek to provide legal support and judicial intervention 5 older women who are in the streets of the city of Valparaiso, in complete abandonment family and institutional. &nbsp; How will we do it? &nbsp; Through the work of a specialized legal partner, who will carry out the search for those who should be responsible for the care and protection of these elderly women who have been violated their human rights, being subjected to living in a street situation. &nbsp; The socio-legal couple consists of a social worker and a lawyer, who: &nbsp; First: They take contact with the people who are injured to propose to them to join a process of integration and reparation of their violated rights, in response to their dual status as older adults and people on the street. At this stage, steps are taken and technical reports are prepared to assess his current socio-legal status. Second: Initiate judicial actions of a protective nature, in order to activate the existing protective system. Both professionals assume an executive coordination initiating a protective, legal and social circuit, presenting complaints or demands before the competent courts in the corresponding cases, in order to restore and empower the violated rights. &nbsp; Why is it important for us? &nbsp; The current policies are characterized by addressing this problem assistance and from charity, failing to problematize this condition as a clear violation of rights, in light of the &#8220;Inter-American Convention on the Protection of the Rights of Older Persons&#8221; in force in the Organization of American States (OAS) since January 2017 and ratified by our country in August of that same year. The &#8220;Convention&#8221; is a normative achievement that puts older people at the center of the legal exercise and forces our country to guarantee the protection and enjoyment of their rights. &nbsp; As a Foundation, we want to go beyond seasonal support actions, which are purely charitable and we even want to go beyond support centered on psychosocial intervention, to also give perspective to law and pilot a new form of intervention, which we believe brings together all the conditions to be replicated by the institutional framework for the elderly. In addition, we focus the action on women who are older adults, whose complex reality remains invisible, because they are less in the streets, compared to men. &nbsp; What impact will our project have? &nbsp; In institutional terms: • We will have created a specialized protective device for older adults from a socio-legal perspective. • We will have an impact on the actions that are addressed to this group that has been excluded three times: due to its gender, age and street situation. &nbsp; In individual terms: • An exclusionary life process is replaced by an integrative and restitutive one of the rights of each person. • Resources are activated from a perspective of protective rights that link the social network with older women and street situations. &nbsp; In relation to the problem: • Cumulative processes of violation of rights are recognized breaking the cycle of permanent damage. • The problem is approached from a rights perspective, not from a poverty perspective. &nbsp; The evaluation of these impacts is carried out through measurements and characterizations that account for: &nbsp; • Check list of rights violated and restitutive actions, in a temporary sequence of short and medium term. • Systematization of socio-legal procedures for the protection of elderly women in street situations. • Identification of judicial protection procedures and final judicial decisions. &nbsp; Each donor is part of the transformation of the life project of an older adult woman living on the street, and the relationship established by the members of a society as agents of change and management of solutions, infecting other people and mobilizing the networks associated with the topic. &nbsp; Why should you trust us? &nbsp; • Because we know how to see the problem in depth and we believe in people. • Because we have been working for 24 years for the quality of life of older adults living on the street. • Because 1 in 3 of our beneficiaries are women, which speaks of the heterogeneization of a problem whose visibility has traditionally been centered on cases involving men. • Because we achieve 90% of effective benefits with 75% success in socio-legal initiatives with people on the street. • Because we cover 100% of violations of rights by resorting to 100% of the instances that the national and international legal order places at the service of vulnerable groups. &nbsp; More information about the &#8220;Gente de la Calle&#8221; Foundation at www.gentedelacalle.cl &nbsp;",,"¿Qué gastos cubrirán tus donaciones?

In Guatemala, there are many poor children who, although they go to school, their parents do not have the resources to buy school supplies. School supplies are something basic and many of us take for granted, but for some it is a luxury, which sadly they do not have. Having the tools to go to school, makes children, feel motivated, prepared and happy to go to their classes. We have spent two consecutive years giving school supplies to our schools and we have seen the great impact it has. It is very complicated for a teacher to be able to teach classes without material, and it is very difficult for a child to come to class and have to borrow a pencil or crayons. GIVING SCHOOL SUPPLIES TO CHILDREN IS INVESTING IN THEIR EDUCATION, THEIR FUTURE! We need your support! With a donation of Q 50 / US $ 7 you give a kit of school supplies to a child!

With your contribution we will give a child: Backpack 4 Notebooks 4 pencils 1 Box of crayons 2 pencils Case Scissors Draft Pencil sharpener Where and when would the supplies be delivered? The donation to the children will take place in the month of December, so that January they have ready the tools at the beginning of classes.

LALA continues to empower these leaders by connecting them to a network of change-makers commited to mentoring young leaders. &nbsp; We believe that empowering Latin America's most promising young leaders to create the change they want to see is the most scalable and sustainable way to transform the region. LALA’s Quito Bootcamp &nbsp; Our 7-day immersive bootcamp is an intensive leadership and social innovation development program that provides young Latin Americans with the abilities, tools and support they need to tackle the problems they are most passionate about. The Quito Bootcamp will host 25 students from all around Latin America during mid-August. About Us: Johan My name is Johan and I'm from Peru. My family and I come from one of the poorest populations in Peru and we have lived at different times like terrorism in Peru. I remember when I was a kid I needed to sell sweets in the streets and that helped me to value every action that my parents did for me and that the most important thing was to study in order to change the world. When I was growing up I was developing different skills, but my greatest power is my leadership ability and my desire to be an agent of change. I feel that through my veins run the desire to change the lives of many people through my example and my commitment to build a sustainable world. Thanks to that, I have the passion and desire to participate in LALA to share with young people the actions that we are carrying out in our country and that contribute with a small change in the world. Mainly to demonstrate to the whole world that young people are present and work hard every day to get a world where we can all have a smile and transmit love. &nbsp; Hesham My name is Hesham AbuJoudeh, I am originally from Jordan but moved to Ecuador in 2014. In two months, I will be going to college as a first-generation student, but before that I would love to attend LALA. When I moved to Ecuador, I did not have an opportunity to join an international high school, and had difficulties adjusting to a new language and culture. I will never forget that when I needed an important history textbook and lacked the funds to buy it, my classmates fundraised the money so that I could learn the subject. In exchange, I translated and taught them some of the topics; an experience that taught me about the solidarity of Ecuadorians. During the Chulla Quiteño and Kuya Raymi festivals, I was chosen to dance and participate in the festivities, making me feel involved and appreciated. The focus of LALA in treasuring Latin America and empowering the youth to change what we dislike is what makes me want to be part of the Quito bootcamp. I believe that attending LALA will teach me more about the importance of education, starting from my own community.",,,,,submitted,,,

Some years ago many medical groups came to Guatemala constantly to perform free reconstructive surgeries but were faced with not enough patients in adequate health condition to receive and recover successfully from the surgery. A unique opportunity was being wasted: The opportunity of free reconstructive surgery. Our effort: Breaching this gap was of great importance to us to allow as many children as possible to achieve free surgery and live a happy and healthy life. Due to this great need, Funsek geared its efforts into supporting infant nutrition for surgery. &nbsp; Our achievements: Thanks to our alliances with other local foundations we are able to offer support in rural communities that are very isolated, where there would be no other option for hope if it weren&#8217;t for participating in this program to correct chronic malnutrition and a cleft lip/palate. When we first joined this effort the program was helping 40 children yearly to obtain nutritional support to achieve surgery. Today, the program supports more than 300 children every year. Babies and children participate in 7 different medical missions throughout the year, which requires nutritional support (pre and post operation) to be supplied constantly. After 6 months of age a baby with the correct weight and hemoglobin level can qualify for free reconstructive surgery. The volunteering doctors and social promotors supervise the entire surgical process with great quality and experience. After surgery the patients can return home but continue to receive nutritional support and monthly visits by the promotors to ensure their correct recovery. Join the challenge to transform the lives of children with a cleft lip! Monthly nutritional support of $38 per baby transforms into the gift of a surgery which would cost around US$10,000 if it were not for the opportunity to receive it for free with medical missions. This month your donation can allow us to help more children, bringing them closer to the surgery they need: For $15 you can support our nutritional program for reconstructive surgery. For $38 you can support the nutrition of a baby with a cleft lip/palate for an entire month. For $50 you can support the nutrition of a baby for a month and gift his mom a breast pump. Join the #GuatemalaGivingChallenge! Help us transform the lives of many babies and children with cleft lip and palate. By donating during the month of July you will also give us the chance to win a US$5,000 donation by Fundación Tigo and continue to widen our reach. Every new donor is a new opportunity to win.

258,45153,02-26-2019,Granddaughters of the Milpa: Support Cultural Education for Tz&#8217;utujil Girls,Asociación Cojolya de Tejedoras Mayas,5000.0,1950.0,39.0,117.0,6.0,257.5,71.18,--,1,0,02-26-2019,04-12-2019,Julia,cojolya@cojolya.org,,"Santiago Atitlán, Guatemala",,,,,"Support young, indigenous Guatemalan women so they can maintain their culture, while reaching their academic potential.","Our Hope: In 2017, the Cojolya Association of Maya Women Weavers began its social program Mano a Mano para el Desarrollo (Hand in Hand for Development), where we offer academic support to our weavers’ families as only 24% of local youth have the opportunity to attend high school. In 2019, we will continue supporting 12 students’ education in our intentional, local, and multi-generational way. In turn, we want to open a space where the young Maya Tz’utujil women who participate in our program can receive a cultural education that empowers them as indigenous women. Our student Yulissa inspired us to expand the social program, “I would like if Mano a Mano could support us with conversations between women, enhancing our knowledge about our culture and our traditions.” Your Impact, Our Community: Balancing the ancestral culture of their home with the westernized education that dominates high schools that barely offer classes in the students’ native dialect of Tz’utujil is a daily practice for girls from Santiago Atitlán. Considering this challenge along with the racism that indigenous people experience across Guatemala, maintaining tradition is far from easy. There, the granddaughters of the milpa find another challenge that transcends the everyday task of choosing between traditional garments that help them identify their heritage or Western clothing that is cheaper and more comfortable for some. Studying is necessary to change the norms while 40% of women in our state of Sololá are illiterate. Your contribution towards these girls’ schooling, through paying for internet access, inscription fees and printing costs, would alleviate economic strain on indigenous families. Furthermore, to become leaders that honor their proud culture, they must practice the indigenous arts and celebrate the Tz’utujil language, maintaining the artistic and resilient memory of their pueblo. Because of this, we want to open a cultural space where indigneous girls feel heard and understood, not only as young women but also as Tz’utujil women. Cultural education in weaving, embroidery, hand-dyeing and Tz’utujil literacy, their native oral language, has great potential to empower young women as traditions such as weaving have therapeutic qualities, and celebrating cultural history is a source of communal pride. Your donation would make a difference in providing tools for these classes and covering the salary for our Social Programs coordinator, a Tz’utujil teacher who wants to support the co-curricular education of these girls through a cultural, feminist lens. Our Students, Tz&#8217;utujil Maya Young Women: Our students have big dreams, and their ambitions are linked to uplifting the community that has inspired them so much with its history of strong women weavers. Lourdes wants to be a doctor while continuing to practice the historically male art of jaspé dyeing. Chonita is going to become a teacher but also wants to learn how to weave at the backstrap loom. Hadasa tells us she wants to become a nurse so that she can cure people but also improve her embroidery skills as her mother is an embroiderer. Julissa is also going to become a teacher this year, but she hopes to maintain the traditions of her ancestors through recounting them to her students. Dolores wants to perfect her beadwork abilities but also become the first woman in her family to graduate high school. The daily perseverance of indigenous Guatemalan women is a testament to women’s strength everywhere. We ask for your support so that these young women don’t have to choose between preserving their culture and reaching their academic potential. We believe that with educational opportunities these Maya granddaughters can disrupt the national marginalization of indigenous women and change Guatemala. Our Experience: About Cojolya and Mano a Mano Despite centuries of persistent domination and systematic racism, the backstrap loom weaving technique is a key Maya art form that has persisted intact in Santiago Atitlan, Guatemala. Cojolya is both a registered non-profit working to improve the lives of our artisans and their families, and a certified Fair Trade organization dedicated to the conservation of the tradition, not as a historical relic, but as an economically viable source of employment for our women weavers. Cojolya first emerged in 1983 during the Guatemalan Civil War. Because indigenous people were suspected of conspiring against the government and joining the resistance, meetings were not allowed by the military, making working with Cojolya difficult at times. Coming together as weavers, celebrating cultural traditions and textile arts, made our work a peaceful yet powerful protest for the right to a sustainable way of living as indigenous women. Beyond economic stability, this history of persecution motivates the artisans to pass this Mayan tradition of cultural self-determination and resilience onto the next generation. Through the Mano a Mano program, we aim to empower this generation. With low secondary school enrollment rates, we seek to tackle three core problems that limit educational opportunities in our beloved Santiago Atitlán: economic difficulties, lack of indigenous mentors, and lack of academic support. Through this campaign Nietas de la Milpa, we want to link our mission to maintain Tz&#8217;utujil Maya culture with our drive to offer our weavers&#8217; children the best educational opportunities through empowering young indigenous women who will act as role models for younger students. As a small organization with a 36 year history, we have extensive experience with community development and a close relationship with our weavers based in mutual trust and intentional, multi-generational collaboration. Since starting Mano a Mano para el Desarrollo, which involves many digital fundraising campaigns, being transparent about where our donors&#8217; contribution goes is even easier through platforms such as GlobalGiving, where we are a top ranked organization.

Girls and adolescents who die at the hands of their aggressors and who do not have the support of governmental institutions that value the seriousness of their history. &nbsp; Gender violence against women in Quintana Roo has worsened in the last ten years as can be seen in the National Household Relations Dynamics Survey of 2006 and 2016, which indicates that women over 15 years of age who claim to have experienced some form of violence, increased from 40.2% in 2006 to 64.7% in 2016 (INEGI, 2006, 2016). In the case of femicides, Merino, Zarkin and Ávila (2016), they document with information from the National Health Information System that Quintana Roo is one of the states with the highest rate of feminicide growth from 2006 to 2012. &nbsp; What are we trying to achieve? &nbsp; With the project &#8220;Girls to Power&#8221; we seek to generate spaces for development and education for girls and young people, because it is essential to create strategies that allow girls to identify the situations of inequality to which they are subjected and begin at an early age to recognize that their potential and rights are fundamental for its full development. These meeting spaces for girls and adolescents imply an appropriation not only physical, but historical, social and psychological. It is in an atmosphere of empathy and sorority where the freedom to question one self about patriarchal oppression is facilitated, but above all, so that adolescents and girls learn to organize, know and empower themselves jointly and from a feminist ethic of fraternity and cooperation. The money raised from the campaign will be used to continue developing this project. &nbsp; About us? &nbsp; The Integral Center of Attention to Women CIAM Cancún A.C .; is a Mexican civil society organization, secular, non-partisan and non-profit, consolidated since 2002 by the journalist, writer and feminist activist Lydia Cacho.

In 2018 Ixchel Museum created an experience, especially for rural schools, is fieldtrip to learn about the textile tradition of Guatemala and it fulfills the obligatory requirements in the national curriculum. This program is designed for 10-12 year-olds and received, during its first year, 100 children from public schools in rural areas, having a major impact on learning processes. Many of the children that visit the Museum through this program are kids that still have the textile tradition, have seen family members or are from places that the textile tradition has disappeared. Project. Fieldtrip to Mayan textile tradition in Guatemala The goal of the Project Fieldtrip to Mayan Textile Tradition in Guatemala is for 300 students to have access to the history of the Mayan textile tradition so that future generations can learn about the origin, identity, values, ancestral traditions and customs of Mayan societies. Every $10 donation represents that opportunity for one student, covering a guided visit to the Museum’s permanent collection. Mayan dress throughout time, educational workshops and educational materials, a snack and transportation. Proposal The texture, designs and colors of our textiles go beyond the simple history of the of the piece itself; they enclose the origin of the Mayan people, their customs and traditions. They are a living part of our history, but more and more the people from Guatemala are unaware of this important aspect of our identity. Since its inception in 1973, the Ixchel Museum of Indigenous garment, costume, works to (safeguard) protect, document and investigate our cultural treasure: the indigenous textile tradition. With the conviction that the textile tradition must be known and revitalized among the new generations, we created in 2018 a new educational experience aimed especially at primary schools. During the special interactive tour, children have the opportunity to learn about the origins, identities, values, traditions and ancestral customs of the Mayan societies and the relevance to our shared identity today. Our main goal Benefit 300 children from rural public schools with the educational experience. The museum receives more than 10,000 visitors annually, but the people who can benefit most from the experience &#8211; children from rural areas &#8211; are the hardest hit to participate in the educational program. are the ones that have the most difficulty participating in the educational program. With your support we can grant 300 primary school students from rural public schools in Guatemala to participate in the tour for free.

The educational experience is designed to fit into the National Curriculum Base (NCB), aimed at students from 10 to 12 years of age. Some of the common factors of the interviewees was: “The connection with the Mayan past, the presentation of the pieces within the exhibition that is complemented with the educational workshops that take place inside the Childrens’ Room and that connect us with our roots.” Yvonne Lopez Contreras. Family mother. &nbsp; “I was impressed by Cofradia&#8217;s room for its colors, and that it taught me respect for Guatemalan traditions.” Dulce Paola Montenegro Soto. 12 years old.

In November of 1983 the Museum inaugurated its current building, within the campus of Marroquín University, and a space was created and designed for children and education: the Children ́s Room Exhibit. The Museum is visited every year by over 10,000 people.

Housing need presents itself wherever people live and work, and it takes many forms and has far-reaching effects. THE NEED Across the globe, urban populations have increased rapidly, often outstripping available housing. A century ago, one out of every five people lived in urban areas; now, for the first time in human history, more than half of us do. In these circumstances — and in many others brought about by various policies, laws and systems — one of the biggest obstacles to a world where everyone has a decent and affordable place to live can be access to land for shelter in the first place. In response to the ever-growing need for shelter in your community and around the world, Habitat works in many ways: new construction, repairs to existing homes, small loans for incremental building and home improvements, help establishing title and ownership to land, advocacy for better laws and systems, disaster prevention and recovery, and more. MEXICO In México the housing deficit represents 28.3% of the total households in the country. This means that 34 million people are living in inadequate housing. A Mexican family without financial supports takes 20 years to build their house, with Habitat; a family completes its training (financial workshops, construction and design assistance, healthy housing program) and construction process in between 6 and 12 months. YOUR SUPPORT With your help we can make a change building a world where everyone has a decent and affordable place to live. Families paying too high a percentage of their income for housing often find themselves making impossible choices. Rent or health care? Food or transportation? A decent and affordable place to live helps families by freeing them from such physical and mental hardships and placing them on a path of new opportunity and increased confidence and self-reliance. Habitat works with families to help them acquire the access, skills and financial education necessary for them to be successful homeowners. By partnering with us, families seize the opportunity and possibility that decent, affordable housing represents. Through shelter, we empower. With your support we can build a new beginning to Benny´s family. The goal is to help Benny to build a new house in the state of Hidalgo, in the community of Bominthza. The cost of the build is $10,000 USD, this amount will cover the construction materials, financial workshops and technical and design assistance.

Your generosity will not only benefit children from indigenous communities, but will also provide ACPC with the opportunity to win an additional US$5,000 at the end of this challenge. So, the more donations we receive, the greater chance we have to win this prize to increase the number of children to receive surgical care. Why it matters When surgical care is not readily available, easily treatable conditions such as Cleft Lip and Palate can become diseased with high fatality rates. In Guatemala, the incidence of Cleft Lip and Palate is significantly high, especially in isolated rural indigenous communities where villagers face huge barriers to medical care. Same scenario for children who struggle with other abnormalities as Syndactyly, Polydactyly, Microtia, and Burns. We, at ACPC, strongly believe that in order to help families to break the cycle of poverty, to overcome disadvantages that threaten their well-being, and moreover for our country to develop, we need to invest in health care for our future generations. We are all aware that poverty in childhood can have life-long consequences: vulnerable children less like to access health care, complete their education, and more likely to suffer from poor nutrition which will reduce their ability to reach their full potential and do not contribute fully to social, political, and economic growth. So the legacy of child poverty can last a lifetime, but we can come together and change it for kids who have being left behind. WE INVITE YOU TO become an Angel to our Angels! Why to trust Asociación Compañero para Cirugía? Because we are a nonprofit organization that since 2008 has worked in coordination with the Ministry of Health, national and international partners and individuals to provide medical, surgical, and nutritional care for about 8,000 people per year. We have dedicated to identify children as early as one week after birth to receive nutritional support, properly care, and to arrive at the ideal level of health to be provided with prompt surgery by dedicated volunteer and compassionate doctors from Canada and USA, but has also focused on the health and well-being of adults who are provided with the medical and surgical care needed as well as on prevention for cervical and breast cancer for rural indigenous women. What will your donation pay for? Asociación Compañero para Cirugia rents a hospital facility in Guatemala city for a one-week period so that surgical teams can provide free of charge surgeries to about 60 patients per week. The rental const for the hospital is local currency Q50,000 per week equivalent to US$6,666 equal to US$111 per patient. The expected amount of $15,000 will cover hospital fee for almost 150 patients. In case the total expected amount is not raised complete, ACPC will keep looking for other sources to complete so that children can have the surgery they desperately need.

In the urban barrios of Guatemala City, over half of all children are chronically malnourished. Only four out of ten teens will graduate high school, forcing the majority of the community’s youth into grossly underpaid jobs or even criminal activity, where they may fall victim to a child-murder rate that is ten times greater than in the U.S. Hope and Empowerment: Peronia Adolescente/Teen Peronia&nbsp;is a&nbsp; Guatemalan youth-founded and operated grassroots non-profit. Since 2004, the organization has worked with local youth, families, schools and community leaders to bring hope and opportunity to Peronia teens. Peronia Adolescente consistently delivers comprehensive educational opportunities including scholarships, tutoring, support groups and creative arts programming. Through an innovative methodology, Peronia Adolescente teens are trained in youth leadership and civic participation and give back to their community through volunteering, public art and performance and local campaigns for child and adolescent protection and rights. Call to action: Since day one, Peronia Adolescente has rented a space in the community to offer its services at no cost to local families. This year, the owners of the rented building that we currently occupy are selling the property, and they have asked the organization to either buy it or leave by fall of 2019. We are convinced that investing in the purchase of this property is a powerful and strategic decision that will strengthen the group’s impact and reach and will provide long-term access to education, support and culture for generations of youth to come.

Another way that Latina families connect to La Casa, is through Citizenship classes and legal services. Since 2014, over 1,080 people have become US Citizens! La Casa Hogar has been accredited by the Department of Justice to provide high quality legal services at an affordable cost allowing families to achieve their goal of gaining citizenship and changing their families&#8217; trajectory. On this Dia Internacional de la Mujer, we want to raise $3,000 to be able to continue offering adult education to over 200 women in 2019. Your gift today will change trajectories! When you give to La Casa, you partner with Latina Families to help her achieve her goals and change her trajectory and that of her entire family. One life transformed today tuns into one family transformed which ultimately turns into the transformation of our Yakima Valley. Invest in your neighbors, invest in your Yakima Valley. Other ways you can transform lives: We understand that not everyone can make a financial contribution, but everyone can partner with Latina families in the Yakima Valley.

Being the dance characterized by being taught in a visual way; Most people with visual disabilities do not dare to resume or learn the dance for fear of being judged and / or not being able to do so. Having as a challenge to face this prejudice by developing a teaching method to be able to dance and verify that a person with disabilities is not totally limited to carry out their activities, if not, that the real limitations are the ability to express themselves and feel. The event consists of two main sections: Shows and social. The first section is that the group with visual disabilities, students and teachers from different dance academies in the State, participate with dance performances of the Salsa and Bachata genres. Where, students and teachers without disabilities use masks to dance, allowing to generate awareness of the skills that are required to develop to implement the dance correctly and demonstrate that it is possible to carry it out. The second consists in freely dancing the genres within a track, where teachers, students and people with disabilities dance in pairs in an inclusive and enjoyable way, provided that all the people who are dancing on the track have masks to raise awareness and empathize the conditions in which a person is The purpose of the event is: Generate awareness of empathy in the entire population regarding the issue of Disability Promote the inclusion and diversity of Persons with Disabilities in every day and recreational environment Raise funds to continue offering free training and services to Persons with Disabilities to achieve their independence, as well as dignified quality of life with visual impairment, and the challenge they face every day to be able to return to their activities. &nbsp; How will we put your donations in action? The money raised will be used for the planning and costs of our second edition of blind dance, an event with the purpose of raising funds to continue offering free training and services to People with Disabilities to achieve their independence, as well as a dignified quality of life. For the event it is necessary: Rent tables, chairs, tablecloths. Lighting and sound rental. Drinks and groceries. Advertising printing and ticketing. Why it matters: We know that disability is characterized and is indicated as a condition that will require assistance for various aspects of life, highlighting those of medical care, education, rehabilitation or guidance, leaving aside the social aspect, a factor that can improve those already mentioned. Then, thinking that the social inclusion of people with disabilities can promote their well-being, while promoting a culture of participation of all social actors with or without disabilities for the common benefit. Every day we witness situations that show us that the functional and emotional consequences of a person with some disability condition are not theirs. If not the interaction, response and exposure that your environment offered. Our purpose is to achieve inclusion and give independence to the person with disability, as well as quality of life worthy. Potential challenges: One of the biggest risks is not getting so many people to attend our event, so we will invest in advertising to spread our cause and event, to collect as much as possible for the association. Other ways that people can help: Any amount in your donation will be of great help and we will be very grateful! Help us spread our cause!

The objective of the project is to be able to support the foundation&#8217;s children in the educational area, providing them with a space where they can take advantage of their time after classes in which they have access to the internet, library, trained personnel to solve doubts. This same to provide an environment away from the tension they live day to day. With the support of your donation, we can provide each child with a space free of abuse, gang persuasion, better educational possibilities, in a safe place they can call home. Your support motivates us to keep going and not give up despite the circumstances in which they may be.

This segment of the population does not normally have access to job opportunities, suffer from lack of integration in society, and have difficulty in economic independence and personal empowerment. Guatemala Inclusiva was created with the purpose or including people with diverse abilities to the work environment. Employment inclusion is an essential step towards an independent life for these young people and gives them an opportunity to develop their skills and demonstrate their abilities. Developing at a work level allows obtaining a salary and also the recognition of social value by family and the rest of citizens. It also provides the opportunity to improve their social skills, their autonomy and their quality of life. Help us to break the labor barrier of people with diverse abilities making your donation TODAY! PROBLEM: Lack of opportunities. In Guatemala, 10.2% of the population has some type of disability, that is, close to 1.6 million people. Of them, only 0.04% have a job!! THE OPPORTUNITY Our project came up as a symbol for &#8220;Catching the &#8220;Dreams&#8221; of many: That of young people to have a decent job and integrate into society in the workplace. That of their relatives who want to see them as independent beings and with the opportunity to improve their future. And, ours to form a conscious and inclusive society where, each passing day, respect and the value of diversity grows for everyone to have the same rights and opportunities. SOLUTION We provide opportunities through a job carried out in conjunction with occupational-technical training (customer service, basic culinary skills, basic barista skills, concierge, art classes, among others), that takes place in the facilities of Café Consciente &#8211; Food With Meaning, a place that was created to support labor inclusion.

We hope to achieve this by fostering a sense of pride and love for Hispanic/Latino culture through free, heritage language and cultural immersion programs. The families who participate in our programs identify as Hispanic/Latino and over 70% come from low to moderate income households. We offer a curriculum that includes strategies based on an educational model to incorporate the stories, traditions and geography of Spanish-speaking countries into each lesson. ISLA supports its students by supporting their communities Students’ families also receive support through our parent community resource program, which provides ISLA parents a safe place to ask questions and offers access to key resources that are essential to Hispanic/Latino families in successfully navigating the school system, workplace and family life in the United States. In addition, ISLA coordinates its own Spanish language story time at local libraries and a volunteer program for students and members of the community. Throughout every aspect of our organization, ISLA strives to convey the values of language and culture to create a stronger, better connected global community. Why bilingual education matters For children of multicultural backgrounds, staying connected to their ancestor’s country of origin can be difficult. The further removed they are from their immigrant roots, the less likely they are to identify with their ancestry. Among the estimated 42.7 million U.S. adults with Hispanic ancestry in 2015, only about 89% self-identified as Hispanic or Latino according to Pew Research Center estimates. When asked why, the remaining 11% often claimed that their Hispanic ancestry is too far back or their background is mixed. Parents can encourage their children’s Hispanic/Latino self-identity through their use of language, but keeping their heritage language alive at home is not always easy as many immigrant families worry about their children falling behind at school if they speak their heritage language at home. &nbsp; Furthermore, many Hispanic and Latino students in North Carolina face barriers to success, such as discrimination on the basis of their skin color, culture, and linguistic background. Many of these bright, passionate students begin to internalize these external prejudices and see their bilingualism and multiculturalism as something that makes them different or inferior, and not as &nbsp;rich and an important parts of themselves that allow them to succeed in ways that English-only speakers cannot. On her son at ISLA, one parent said, &#8220;He has learned that speaking Spanish is not an odd thing that only his family does, but that there are other families like ours that he can now communicate and share things in common with.&#8221; Through high-quality education in Spanish, ISLA aims to&nbsp;lessen the academic achievement gap between Hispanic/Latino and non-Hispanic/Latino youth.&nbsp;We promote the value of speaking a native language &nbsp;and recognize the importance of connecting communities where conversations can be held and cultural cues are provided as children grow up, which can have a large impact on their identity in adulthood. &nbsp;Of the programs offered by ISLA, a member of our teaching staff recently claimed, “ISLA is well known for its commitment to helping children in the Latino community to improve and maintain their Spanish, as well as for their work to promote skills development that will give these children better opportunities in the future.”",,"DONATIONS MADE TO ISLA ARE ALLOCATED TO SUPPORT THE FOLLOWING PROGRAMS: ISLA los Sábados → Weekly heritage language immersion program for children ages 4 to 14 that aims to close the achievement gap and open doors for Hispanic/Latino youth.

Nine women have chosen this location to experience an empowering birth, pointing out the advantage of it being this closer to their homes. Many women are from La Valenciana, a poor neighborhood with lots of needs, amongst them, the need of women for dignified, quality care. As a pilot project the Birth Home has proven that there is a real need for this service and now Mujeres Aliadas wants to take it a step forward. The situation is ideal: we have a beautiful space that is being donated for us y to use and we have a volunteer midwife to help for a year. The only things we need to turn this shared dream into a reality is your support. We want to raise $8,000 dollars to make a few adaptations to the room and buy some basic equipment, to make it more comfortable and secure for women and their families. We need another midwife to help and supplies for the rest of the year. With the money we raise will also make a fund to help at least 10 women who would like to birth with us, but can’t afford to pay it all. Help us open our Birth Center in Patzcuaro! Give women the chance to experience dignified, quality care close to their homes! Help us change the world one birth at a time! Why it matters: For more than a decade, Mujeres Aliadas has worked to promote rights and provide sexual and reproductive healthcare based on the model of Professional Midwifery. We’ve heard, seen and experienced the reality that many women experience while giving birth at a public hospital. The horror stories include verbal violence, unnecessary procedures, negligence and abuse. Turning this pilot project into a real Birth Center will give women from this neighborhood access to high quality care that otherwise would be inaccessible for them. It also is a convenient location for other women in Patzcuaro and surrounding villages, allowing more women and families to experience a beautiful empowering birth. There is a phrase from a French Obstetrician, Michael Odent that says: “To change the world, we must first change the way babies are being born.” Help us open our Birth Center in Patzcuaro! Help us change the world one birth at a time! How will the funds be used? The first $5,500 we raise will go into turning the space into a comfortable, safe environment for women to give birth in. It includes the salary for a second midwife, adaptations to the birthing room, accommodations for the family, and some additional equipment and supplies. The second $2,500 dollars will go directly to help women who can’t afford our price of $5,000 pesos (USD $250) a birth.

To achieve this purpose, it is essential to have a bank of benefactors, which is a tool that allows to find in an organized way, investors that support the cause for which ASCBAM works. Through this project we seek to implement the bank of benefactors, which will be achieved with thorough and detailed research of all entities, individuals, companies, organizations, corporations and in general, any body that supports projects that benefit the elderly population and that they comply with the requirements established in the project department. BACKGROUND 13 years ago, for the CBA welfare centers of Santander to maintain dignified conditions, with quality of life of the older adult was really a very laborious job, the extensive days of the administrators and the ability to make use of the scarce resources they receive were not enough. . The state had forgotten about its institutionalized octogenarian population, which have mostly suffered from extreme poverty; With this problem each institution tried to make itself felt, but its voice did not transcend effectively. At the initiative of some institutions committed to the defense of the rights of the elderly, who saw the need to join individual efforts and work in a network so that the needs of their elders could be heard, the Santandereana Association was founded on June 8, 2006 of welfare centers of the older adult ASCBAM, a guild of more than 60 institutions, works with 400 employees and serves about 5000 senior citizens. Once the ASCBAM was created, the short, medium and long-term objectives were created, according to the primordial needs of both the elderly and those who have the responsibility to take care of them. ASCBAM is financed by apostolates of its associates, monthly the 60 affiliated welfare centers contribute for the operation of the association. The patrimony of the Association is made up of economic contributions, donations and quotas of its members, contributions, subsidies or permitted legacies made by natural or juridical persons, national or foreign and that ASCBAM accepts; the help they receive from public or private, national and foreign entities; and for all other goods, that for any valid concept or title, enter the Association. However, the sum of all the grants does not reach to satisfy the annual budget of sustainability of the health centers of Santander, because the percentage of annual deficit exceeds even 50%, it is then that ASCBAM decides to implement the department of bank of benefactors, own as of May 2019, with the aim of through projects that can generate resources that benefit the adult population in Santander. JUSTIFICATION Currently, ASCBAM does not count on benefactors to support it, the main source of resources obtained by the welfare centers of the elderly is charity. According to the report made in the needs bank, it could be determined that the welfare centers of the elderly have an annual deficit of 10% and as time goes by, their level of indebtedness increases; 49% of its budget is made up of own resources that come mostly by the donations of participants and by money from their officials. For the Santandereana Association of Adult Welfare Centers ASCBAM, the projects are a means to manage activities that help to strengthen the welfare centers of the elderly and the association, generating a higher quality of life for the members. There are national and international organizations that support projects of a social nature but that until now have not been explored by ASCBAM, with the creation of the bank of benefactors, as well as the conditions and the means to be beneficiaries of public and private resources, since have information on the type of projects and population that they support, you can participate in the calls. ASCBAM has the Projects department, which is stipulated the step by step that must be followed to carry out the achievement of associative projects, which promote sustainable development in the welfare centers of the elderly. MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THE PROJECT THE SANTANDEREAN ASSOCIATION OF WELL-BEING CENTERS FOR THE ELDERLY ADULT (ASCBAM) was born more than 8 years ago with the great desire and desire to work for one of the most vulnerable and neglected sectors such as the elderly in circumstances of manifest weakness, forgotten by its own family, state and society, currently ASCBAM serves 62 institutions that shelter and serve more than 6,300 older adults of which around 60% of these are disabled. With the passage of time and with the gradual growth of our association, we have seen the need to improve day by day the latent needs that our partner institutions have been presenting, since we are aware that each day services and services must be improved. the quality of life of our elderly population attended It is for this reason that today we take the boldness to knock on their doors and request their collaboration, so that we study the possibility and feasibility of approving our project of ACQUISITION OF: CHAIRS FOR BATHROOM OF THE ELDERLY ADULTS SERVED AT ADULT BINESTAR CENTERS ASOBAM ASOCIADOS ASSOCIATE this in order to provide at least three (3) chairs for bathing of older adults in each welfare center affiliated with ASCBAM, and facilitate the bathing of the sickest and prostrate. 1. With these chairs for bathroom can help to improve one of the latent needs that are presented by each of the partner institutions in terms of daily bathing of older adults since their delicate health and physical disability is quite difficult Mobility for your daily bath and grooming. 2. With these bath chairs you can also help to improve the daily work done by the health personnel or caregivers who care for the elderly as it facilitates more the transfer of each older adult at the time of taking them to the bathroom for the realization of their physiological needs and also provides more comfort and comfort to each older adult improving their quality of life. It is for this reason that today we request your valuable collaboration, to be taken into account our project ACQUISITION OF: CHAIRS FOR BATH OF THE ELDERLY ADDRESSED AT THE WELL-BEING CENTERS OF THE ELDERLY ASSOCIATED ASCBAM, which would greatly benefit the quality of life of our vulnerable older adult population in the department of Santander.

According to BSP survey data, the janitorial industry is dominated by female workers who make up 65% of the workforce and are majority immigrants from Mexico and Central America. Janitor women work from 6:00 p.m. until 2:30 a.m., getting limited amounts of sleep to tend to their day-time responsibilities as mothers, caregivers, and the primary breadwinners in their household. Despite this exhausting schedule, janitor women exhibit incredible perseverance to provide and support their families and are often seen as superheroes in the eyes of their children. We believe education and training make a world of difference in improving the stability, health, and opportunities for working women and their families. Support Mujeres in the Janitorial Industry on International Women&#8217;s Day Building Skills Partnership is a California nonprofit that works to bridge the basic skills gap for low-income janitors, helping them to succeed in their personal and professional lives. 92% of the janitors in our programs are from Mexico and Central America and 65% of the workforce are women. Janitor women face significant barriers to becoming participating members of their communities due to their schedules that provide little to no time for education and training. Building Skills Partnership believes the solution is educational access that paves a road to career advancement, financial stability, physical health, linguistic integration, and naturalization. On March 8, BSP will stand in solidarity with Latina serving organizations around the world and hold a campaign to support mujeres in the janitorial industry. We invite you to join us on this global day of recognition to celebrate the strength and contributions of janitor women! Why it matters According to survey data collected from over 4,000 of the janitors in our programs, janitor women make up 65% of the workforce. 65% of all participants have less than a high-school diploma and 41% have less than an 8th grade education. These women have left their home country for a variety of reasons, some to escape violence and war, others to attain better opportunities for their families. Janitors provide a tangible benefit to our workplaces by ensuring that spaces of work are clean and safe for the next day. Investing in this workforce is an investment in our communities and economies. How the funds will be used The janitor women in our programs have celebrated successes such as attaining a promotion at work, becoming a new American citizen, instilling healthy eating habits in their household, and accomplishing a financial savings goal. Donations will directly support programming that currently benefits over 4,000 immigrant janitors. Janitors participate in classes at their work site or at their local BSP office. Our unique partnership model with building owners, janitorial employers, and community organizations allows BSP to meet workers where they are.

Shelters are a mechanism that prevents femicides. It is necessary to have a space for survivors of violence to have somewhere to go, receive professional attention and rebuild their lives. The Objective is to gather enough to provide a decent and safe space for psychological, legal and medical care of 9 women, as well as courses and workshops, to help them create tools so they can have an independent life and free of violence. Your donation will cover the basic needs of shelter, food, hot water, electricity, medicines and medical consultations, psychological therapy, legal advice, procedures. We will support the number of women who with this amount can receive comprehensive care according to our model. We have a model of comprehensive care that allows women to find the strength and the reasons to rebuild their lives. All the people who work at Espacio Mujeres are women specialists in their field, from a gender perspective and a human rights approach. The impact will be measured through indicators that show their processes during the stay in the Refuge and the corresponding follow-ups established in our model of care, which include psychological, legal and labor reintegration and independent living. This project is valuable because it saves women&#8217;s lives as well as giving them opportunities that resignify their future. Espacio Mujeres has been fulfilling its mission for 10 years. Violence against women is a problem deeply rooted in our culture and society, and we seek to eradicate it through our work supporting women, girls and boys and adolescents who experience gender-based violence in the domestic sphere, to take them to a place where they can exercise their full exercise of their rights. We are pioneers in the fight against violence, our model has been used as a replica in other institutions. We are part of the National Shelter Network.

It is URGENT in Colombia to maintain the campaigns, actions, complaints about violence against girls and women. SUPPORT OUR CAMPAIGN, WE NEED TO KEEP OUR ACTIONS AND THAT THE VOICE OF THE WOMEN IS LISTENED. Why is this important to you, your team, or your organization? For the Ruta Pacífica de las Mujeres and for Colombian women it is URGENT and IMPORTANT that the actions of public denunciation of the violence suffered by girls and women be maintained. That we can not be on the Street, in the media with our slogans and claims, deepens the silence that the Colombian State maintains regarding this situation. For this, we seek the support of all people so that on March 8, the International Day of Human Rights of Women, we can go out into the 10 departments in which we have a presence and say NO MORE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN. Not only we will do it next March 8, without the last Tuesday of each month throughout the year 2019. &nbsp; WE ARE IN RESISTANCE, PERSISTENCE, AND NEVER DESIRED TO DENOUNCE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN IN COLOMBIA What is your goal, how do you plan to accomplish it and how can people’s support/donations help you get there? Objective: Through the social mobilization, the Ruta Pacifica de las Mujeres places in the public scenario in 10 Colombian departments, the situation of violence, discrimination and inequality in which women and girls are found in the country. The saplings, marches, radio programs, workshops, forums, communications, among other actions are the way the Ruta Pacifica positions its commitment to a life free of violence for women. We require support for March 8 to manage 10 actions in each of our regional, in order to hold talks, sit-ins, marches, mobilizations, radio campaigns and social networks, with symbolic and political bets. Women in Black Additionally, the Ruta Pacífica de las Mujeres after establishing an International and National alliance, installed as a symbolic-political practice the Women in Black seedlings the last Tuesday of each month, performing them in public spaces and representative places in the main Colombian cities where it is present. This practice has consolidated regional and national mobilizations where 2,000 to 10,000 women participate, as a contribution to the construction of women as social and political subjects that manifest themselves peacefully and permanently against armed conflicts and against violence that for years They have put women as spoils of war. How we’ll put your donations to work Explain how much money you need and where it is going. What will funds cover? Be transparent and specific to build trust in your supporters. National badges, for women: scarves, shirts and artistic makeup. Regarding advertising: banners and posters alluding to the theme.

We need refreshments and snacks for women We require 10 thousand dollars Describe where your funds will go if you don’t reach your entire goal.

All the support we receive is useful, it will be used in an efficient and transparent manner and the territories where women have more economic disadvantages such as Chocó, Putumayo are prioritized .

Why it matters: Use this section to give more details and talk about the big picture. What impact will you have if this project becomes a reality? How will you measure the impact? The Ruta Pacifica is the women&#8217;s movement against war that has been fighting for more than 20 years in Colombia because women live free of violence and the armed conflict is resolved by negotiation and a stable and lasting peace is built The actions undertaken by Ruta Pacífica are a guarantee of social mobilization, inclusive participation of the diversity of women and their territories and this has positioned it as a unique movement of its kind in Colombia. Therefore, the impact is national, is to have in 10 regions of the country women in the street permanently pronouncing for violence against women. The impact will be measured by the reports of the coordinators in each region, by the photographic record and attendance lists. &nbsp; Explain why your project is valuable to your supporters and the world (or the Latino community). It is valuable because a world where women suffer discrimination, violence and inequality is a world that is neither FAIR nor EQUALITARY. Therefore, everything that is done from society to denounce and make visible what is happening against women and girls is important, necessary and urgent. &nbsp; Why should people trust you? Reference success stats from similar projects or point to your organization’s track record.

Last year, together with donors, we were able to impact more than 42 communities in extreme poverty in Costa Rica. We firmly believe that education is one of the most important tools to get out of poverty. Our programs not only seek to impact the lives of the participants, but also their families, communities and our country. Your contribution and support is extremely important for us. You can give the opportunity to a woman and her family to get out of poverty and achieve who list transformational change and development. For more than 4 years, we have been creating leaders among those in poverty, social injustice and discrimination. December 31st, 2018 government report shows that Costa Rica has a high share of women suffering from deprivations, including the incidence of income poverty. The report explains that if we were to mobilize men the poverty line of 21.8% would come down to 17%, but if we were to mobilize women the it would reduce to 13%. Also, low educational attainment (60.6%) and the share of women with no one to count on (10%), unemployment rate 50% higher among women relative to men, and the incidence of low pay among women being 80% higher than men, make the programs of TRANSFORMA a solution for Costa Rica. For every $ 50 per month, 1 woman can join our program for 1 month. With $ 500, 1 woman will receive full education for 1 year. This amount includes courses of work-technical skill development for basic competencies so that they can work, materials for the courses, entrepreneurial training, values teaching, human formation, leadership courses and a follow-up to each one of the participants, by our group of volunteers. In addition, we include child care and food during the coffee break for every woman and their children.

She didn&#8217;t understand the changes that were happening in her body. She even missed school. Can you imagine this happening to you? Not knowing how to act when you have your period generates inequality. Fortunately, Save the Children gave her support. Paty today is not ashamed of her period, she has sanitary pads at school and good hygiene.

In recent years, the problem continues to be alarming, according to the Ministry of the Interior between 2016 and 2017 there have been 174 victims of trafficking, however, most data are only estimates because underreporting prevails in Colombia.

Help us win the Guatemala Giving Challenge and the $5,000 grand prize! We at Hogar Margarita Cruz Ruíz care for elderly women in need of a place to call home. We strive to give them the best care we can, by caring from their bodies to their souls. This journey to help, has taken us to meet great, wonderful people who want to make a difference in the world by giving disinterestedly. All of those contributors are responsible for the long lasting labor our home has been able to do through out 43 years. We believe everyone has something to share. Wether is time, money, a special talent, smiles, hope, prayers or some other thing valuable to give to our elderly the best time here. Our goal is to gather at least 50 donations from 50 of these amazing people like you, interested in making a differences, donating as little as $5.00 to how much as you wish. This will give us 50 chances to win the $5,000 to be raffled by HIP Give and TIGO Foundation, within all participant organizations. With your help we can extend the shaded area in our gardens The Home has many needs, but our goal right now is to expand the shady areas through out the gardens so there is more space for our residents to enjoy being in open air. Enjoying time outside, surrounded by nature can be one of the most beneficial activities to do for our elderly. But today we have a limited space where to take them to. For us is very important they get some time breathing fresh air every day. So if we win this prize, our dear ladies will have the opportunity to enjoy more of this time outside. If we get to our $1,000 goal we will be able to buy a small awning with shade enough for two persons. If we win the $5,000 price, we will be able to build a large pergola with enough shade to fit 10! About Hogar Margarita Cruz Ruíz We have been working for the elderly since 1976. The vision of our founder, Margarita Cruz Ruíz, was to bring love and help to those in more need. Still to this date, being elderly, woman, with limited to any resources is one of the most vulnerable profiles in our country and in many others. Our organization is the legacy of this extraordinary human being, who chose to make a difference every day of her life. Is our deepest wish to keep her memory and her work alive for generations to come. Other ways to help You can also help us by spreading the word around about our project!
